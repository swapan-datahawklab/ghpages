**Swapan**: best way to get shell script output from openshift containers without remote shell access

**ChatGPT**: **Considering options for shell script output**

Okay, the user is asking how to get shell script output from OpenShift containers without remote shell access. That probably means using logging features like the `oc logs` command to fetch output. I could suggest redirecting script output to standard output or logging it to a file, then retrieving it using `oc logs`. Another option might be using the OpenShift API or build config for logging. Seems like `oc logs` is the main tool here for this purpose.

**Exploring options for non-remote shell access**

To get shell script output from an OpenShift container without remote shell access, a good option is to modify the script to redirect output to `stdout`. Since OpenShift containers run as pods in Kubernetes, the output written to `stdout` can be accessed using the `oc logs` command. Another approach could be using a logging solution like ELK or setting up a shared persistent volume to access file-based outputs. Setting up a sidecar to forward logs or using a log forwarder like Fluentd is also a viable solution.

**Summarizing ways to get script output**

To get shell script output from OpenShift containers without remote shell access, the best approach is to direct output to `stdout`/`stderr`, then use `oc logs` to retrieve it. If that's not viable, consider redirecting output to a file and using `oc cp` to copy it, though that still might require access to the container’s filesystem. Another option is deploying a sidecar container to log and forward output or integrating with an external logging solution like Fluentd or Logstash.

**ChatGPT**: The recommended approach in OpenShift (and Kubernetes in general) is to design your container so that all output is sent to standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr). This way, you don’t need to “ssh” (or use remote shell access) to get your shell script’s output – you can simply retrieve it via the built‐in logging mechanisms. Here are some detailed strategies:

---

### 1. Log to stdout/stderr

**Why?**  
Containers are generally ephemeral, and best practices dictate that applications should log to stdout/stderr. The container runtime (and OpenShift) automatically collects these logs. This means that your shell script’s output, if sent to stdout/stderr, will automatically appear in the pod logs.

**How?**  
- **Modify your script:** Ensure that your script uses commands like `echo` or writes directly to stdout.  
- **Redirect file outputs:** If your script writes to a file, consider redirecting the output to stdout. For example:
  ```bash
  # Instead of this:
  ./my_script.sh > /var/log/myscript.log 2>&1
  
  # Do this:
  ./my_script.sh >> /proc/1/fd/1 2>> /proc/1/fd/2
  ```
  This redirects stdout (`>> /proc/1/fd/1`) and stderr (`2>> /proc/1/fd/2`) to the main process’ stdout/stderr, which are then picked up by the container logging system.

---

### 2. Use the `oc logs` Command

Once your container outputs its logs to stdout/stderr, you can simply retrieve the logs using OpenShift’s CLI:

```bash
oc logs <pod-name>
```

If your pod has multiple containers, you can specify the container name:

```bash
oc logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>
```

This command lets you view the log output of your container without needing to establish a shell session.

---

### 3. Consider a Sidecar or Logging Aggregator (if needed)

If for some reason you cannot modify the script to log to stdout (for example, if it must write to a file), you have a couple of options:

- **Sidecar Container:**  
  Deploy a sidecar container that tails the log file and writes its output to stdout. A simple `tail -F /path/to/log` in a sidecar container can forward the logs to the main pod log stream.

- **Centralized Logging:**  
  Integrate with a logging aggregator (like Fluentd, Logstash, or the EFK/ELK stack) that can pick up file logs. However, the recommended approach is still to log to stdout whenever possible.

---

### 4. Running Scripts as Jobs or Init Containers

If the shell script is meant to run once (or on a schedule), consider using:

- **Kubernetes Jobs/CronJobs:**  
  These resources are designed for running scripts or batch tasks. Their logs are automatically collected and can be inspected with `oc logs`.

- **Init Containers:**  
  If the script needs to run before your main container starts, you can use an init container. The output of the init container is also available through `oc logs` (by specifying the init container’s name).

---

### Summary

The **best way** to get shell script output from OpenShift containers **without remote shell access** is to:
1. **Modify your containerized application (or script) to log to stdout/stderr.**
2. **Retrieve the logs using the `oc logs` command or your centralized logging solution.**

This method adheres to container best practices and avoids the security risks and complexity associated with enabling remote shell access.
