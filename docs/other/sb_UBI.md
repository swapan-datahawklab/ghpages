**Swapan**: ubi9/openjdk-17 builder ubi9/openjdk-17-runtime multi stage spring boot dockerfile

**ChatGPT**: To create a multi-stage Spring Boot Dockerfile using the `ubi9/openjdk-17` builder and `ubi9/openjdk-17-runtime` for a runtime stage, you can follow the structure below. This will optimize your image by only including necessary runtime dependencies in the final image.

Here's an example Dockerfile for a Spring Boot application:

```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build Stage
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/openjdk-17 as builder

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy Maven/Gradle wrapper and necessary files (optional if using Maven/Gradle)
COPY mvnw* ./
COPY .mvn .mvn
COPY pom.xml .

# Download dependencies
RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline -B

# Copy the source code
COPY src src

# Build the application
RUN ./mvnw package -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Runtime Stage
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/openjdk-17-runtime

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the built JAR file from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# Expose port 8080 (adjust if needed)
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Build Stage (`ubi9/openjdk-17`)**: This stage uses the UBI 9 OpenJDK 17 image for building the Spring Boot application. It sets up Maven (or Gradle if needed), downloads dependencies, and packages the application. This stage is discarded after building.
   
2. **Runtime Stage (`ubi9/openjdk-17-runtime`)**: This stage uses the UBI 9 OpenJDK 17 runtime image to run the application with only the necessary runtime libraries, reducing the size of the final image.

3. **Optimization**: The multi-stage build ensures that only the minimal runtime environment is included in the final image, while keeping the build tools and intermediate artifacts out of it.
