**Swapan**: benefits of starting spring with Spring Boot Application.context Initializer instead of SpringApplication.run

**ChatGPT**: Using `ApplicationContextInitializer` to start a Spring Boot application can offer specific advantages over `SpringApplication.run` in particular contexts. Here are the benefits and differences:

1. **Custom Initialization Logic**:
   - `ApplicationContextInitializer` allows you to execute custom logic right before the Spring context is refreshed, which means you can programmatically modify the `ApplicationContext` before any beans are loaded or instantiated.
   - This can be helpful if you need to adjust configuration properties, register specific beans conditionally, or perform other advanced setup tasks that influence the application context itself.

2. **More Control Over Configuration**:
   - When using `ApplicationContextInitializer`, you gain more granular control over the configuration process, enabling you to conditionally load or modify configurations in response to specific environment settings or profiles before Spring processes them fully.

3. **Enhanced Testing Capabilities**:
   - Since `ApplicationContextInitializer` allows configuration of the application context before beans are loaded, itâ€™s valuable for integration testing setups where you might need to replace or mock certain beans or properties at the context level without altering the main application configuration.

4. **Integration with External Systems**:
   - If your application relies on integration with external systems, using `ApplicationContextInitializer` can allow you to perform preliminary setups like establishing connections or verifying external dependencies before your primary application beans initialize.

5. **Useful in Modular or Multi-Context Applications**:
   - For complex applications that use multiple contexts or modular configurations, `ApplicationContextInitializer` allows configuring each context separately, which can streamline application configuration and avoid startup issues caused by missing dependencies in child contexts.

**When to use `ApplicationContextInitializer` over `SpringApplication.run`**:
- Use it when you need additional customization or want to perform preliminary actions at the context level before the beans load.
