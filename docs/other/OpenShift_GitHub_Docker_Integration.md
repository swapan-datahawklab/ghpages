**Swapan**: openshift developer sandbox source and target docker registry on github 

**ChatGPT**: **Setting up a pipeline**

OK, let me see. The user is likely after instructions to link the OpenShift Developer Sandbox with a Docker registry, including pulling source code from GitHub, building an image, and pushing it to a registry using a pipeline.

**Pulling together**

I’m gathering info on the OpenShift Developer Sandbox and how to build a pipeline for pulling source code from GitHub or Docker and pushing it to a Docker registry, possibly using Tekton pipelines.

**ChatGPT**: Below is a high-level guide on how you can leverage the OpenShift Developer Sandbox to build from source on GitHub and then push or pull container images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry). The steps can vary depending on your development workflow, but this should give you a good starting point.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

1. **OpenShift Developer Sandbox account**  
   - Sign up at [OpenShift Developer Sandbox](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox).

2. **GitHub repository**  
   - Your application source code is stored on GitHub.

3. **Container registry account**  
   - For Docker Hub, sign up at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).  
   - For GitHub Container Registry, you can use your GitHub account (with appropriate Personal Access Tokens configured).

4. **Access tokens or credentials**  
   - You will need either:
     - A Docker Hub username and password (or a personal access token, recommended), **or**
     - A GitHub Container Registry [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

---

## 2. Configure OpenShift Developer Sandbox

1. **Log into the Sandbox**  
   Go to [OpenShift Developer Sandbox](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox) and log in with your Red Hat account. You will be taken to the OpenShift console for your sandbox environment.

2. **Create a new project/namespace**  
   - Click on **Projects** in the left navigation.
   - Click **Create Project** and enter a name (e.g., `my-demo-app`).

---

## 3. Setting Up Image Pulling/Push Credentials

Before you can push or pull to external registries, you need to provide your registry credentials to the OpenShift cluster:

### 3.1 Create a Secret with Docker Hub (or GitHub Registry) credentials

1. **Obtain your Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry credentials**  
   - Docker Hub:
     ```bash
     oc create secret docker-registry dockerhub-secret \
       --docker-username=<YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME> \
       --docker-password=<YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD_OR_TOKEN> \
       --docker-server=docker.io \
       --namespace=my-demo-app
     ```
   - GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io):
     ```bash
     oc create secret docker-registry githubcr-secret \
       --docker-username=<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME> \
       --docker-password=<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> \
       --docker-server=ghcr.io \
       --namespace=my-demo-app
     ```

2. **Link the secret to your service account**  
   So that builds and deployments can use it:
   ```bash
   oc secrets link default dockerhub-secret --for=pull
   oc secrets link builder dockerhub-secret
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   oc secrets link default githubcr-secret --for=pull
   oc secrets link builder githubcr-secret
   ```

(This allows pods in your project to pull images from your private registry and also push images during the build process if required.)

---

## 4. Building an Image from GitHub Source

There are a couple of ways to build your application’s container image on OpenShift. Below are two common approaches:

### 4.1 Using S2I (Source-to-Image)

1. **Create a new BuildConfig** using S2I and your GitHub repo:
   ```bash
   oc new-build \
     --name=my-demo-app \
     --binary=false \
     --strategy=s2i \
     --image-stream=openshift/python:3.9  \
     --source-secret=github-source-secret \
     https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git
   ```
   *Adjust the above parameters for your language runtime or builder image (e.g., `python:3.9`, `nodejs:16`, `java:11`, etc.).*

2. **Check the Build**  
   ```bash
   oc logs -f bc/my-demo-app
   ```
   Once completed, you should see a new **ImageStream** in your project.

### 4.2 Using Dockerfile (Docker strategy)

If your repo already has a Dockerfile:

1. **Create BuildConfig** with Docker strategy:
   ```bash
   oc new-build \
     --name=my-demo-app \
     --binary=false \
     --strategy=docker \
     --dockerfile=Dockerfile \
     --source-secret=github-source-secret \
     https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git
   ```
2. **Check the Build**:
   ```bash
   oc logs -f bc/my-demo-app
   ```

**Note**: If you need a “source secret” to pull private repos from GitHub, create one:
```bash
oc create secret generic github-source-secret \
  --from-literal=username=<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME> \
  --from-literal=password=<YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
oc secrets link builder github-source-secret
```
Then reference `--source-secret=github-source-secret` when creating the build.

## 5. Pushing the Built Image to an External Registry

Once your BuildConfig completes successfully, OpenShift will place the resulting image into an ImageStream within your project. If you want to push this image to Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry, you can do so in a couple of ways:

### 5.1 Using `oc tag` and `oc import-image` / `oc image mirror`

1. **Tag the internal ImageStream to your external registry**:
   ```bash
   oc tag my-demo-app:latest docker.io/<YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/my-demo-app:latest
   ```
2. **Mirror the image**:
   ```bash
   oc image mirror \
     image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/my-demo-app/my-demo-app:latest \
     docker.io/<YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/my-demo-app:latest
   ```
   *Make sure you created a secret for Docker Hub or GitHub CR, and it’s linked to the service account as shown above.*

### 5.2 BuildConfig `pushSecret` & Custom Strategy

In some advanced pipelines, you can specify a `pushSecret` in your `BuildConfig`:
```yaml
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: my-demo-app
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: DockerImage
      name: docker.io/<YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/my-demo-app:latest
    pushSecret:
      name: dockerhub-secret
  ...
```
When the build finishes, OpenShift automatically pushes the image to your external registry.

---

## 6. Using Tekton Pipelines (Optional)

If you want to automate the whole process (build, test, push) with Tekton:

1. **Install/Enable Pipelines Operator**  
   - In the Developer Sandbox, you often have Tekton Pipelines pre-installed. Otherwise, install the [OpenShift Pipelines Operator](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cicd/pipelines/installing-pipelines.html).

2. **Create a Pipeline** that:
   1. Clones your GitHub repository.
   2. Builds a container image (using [Buildah or Kaniko tasks](https://hub.tekton.dev/)).
   3. Pushes the image to Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry using your credentials.

A very minimal Tekton Pipeline YAML might look like this (using buildah example):

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: build-and-push-pipeline
spec:
  tasks:
  - name: build-push
    taskRef:
      name: buildah
      kind: ClusterTask
    params:
    - name: IMAGE
      value: docker.io/<YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/my-demo-app:latest
    - name: DOCKERFILE
      value: ./Dockerfile
    - name: CONTEXT
      value: .
    workspaces:
    - name: source
  workspaces:
  - name: source
```
And you would link your secrets as needed for authentication.

---

## 7. Deploying the Application in the Sandbox

Once your image is built and/or pushed:

1. **Deploy** in the Developer Sandbox:
   ```bash
   oc new-app --name=my-demo-app \
     docker.io/<YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/my-demo-app:latest
   ```
   or from the local ImageStream:
   ```bash
   oc new-app my-demo-app:latest
   ```

2. **Expose a Route**:
   ```bash
   oc expose svc/my-demo-app
   ```
   Check `oc get routes` for your public URL.

---

## 8. Summary of the Workflow

1. **Create/OpenShift**: Create a project and set up secrets.  
2. **Build**: Use `oc new-build` or a Tekton pipeline to build from GitHub source.  
3. **Push**: Mirror/tag or configure `pushSecret` to upload your container image to Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry.  
4. **Run**: Deploy the image in OpenShift, expose a route, and you’re up and running!

**That’s it!** With these steps, you should be able to pull source code from GitHub, build a container image in the OpenShift Developer Sandbox, and push the result to an external Docker Registry (Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry). Once configured, you can further automate the workflow with Tekton, GitHub Actions, or other CI/CD tools.
