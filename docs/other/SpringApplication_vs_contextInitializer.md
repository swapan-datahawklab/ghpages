**Swapan**: why this SpringApplication.run and not SpringApplication.contextInitializer to start a spring application?

**ChatGPT**: `SpringApplication.run` is the preferred method to start a Spring application because it simplifies the process and offers additional configuration options. Here’s a breakdown of why `SpringApplication.run` is typically chosen over directly calling `contextInitializer` or a similar method:

1. **Encapsulation of Setup**: `SpringApplication.run` encapsulates the entire initialization and startup process, including creating an `ApplicationContext`, configuring beans, loading properties, and initializing the environment.

2. **Error Handling**: `SpringApplication.run` provides built-in error handling and diagnostics, which make it easier to manage startup failures and debugging.

3. **Listeners and Initializers**: `SpringApplication.run` triggers the application’s lifecycle events (such as `ApplicationStartedEvent` and `ApplicationReadyEvent`) and applies any registered `ApplicationContextInitializer`s and `ApplicationListener`s, adding a structured way to handle events during startup.

4. **Configuration Options**: `SpringApplication.run` allows for configuration through the `SpringApplication` class, such as setting the application’s banner, custom properties, profiles, and lazy initialization, which makes it flexible and customizable.

5. **Cross-Environment Compatibility**: It automatically configures the application for the environment it’s running in (web application, command-line application, etc.) based on detected settings, simplifying deployment and testing in different contexts.

In contrast, directly using a `contextInitializer` would bypass these conveniences, making it less manageable, especially in complex or production-grade applications.

**Swapan**: what is the impact of doing SpringApplication.contextInitializer  more details please

**ChatGPT**: Using `SpringApplication.contextInitializer` directly (or a similar approach that manually initializes the `ApplicationContext` without `SpringApplication.run`) can have several impacts on how a Spring Boot application is set up and operates. Here’s a detailed look at the effects of bypassing `SpringApplication.run`:

### 1. **Lifecycle Events and Listeners**

   - **Missing Events**: `SpringApplication.run` fires several lifecycle events, such as `ApplicationStartingEvent`, `ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent`, `ApplicationContextInitializedEvent`, `ApplicationPreparedEvent`, and `ApplicationStartedEvent`. These are often essential for setting up resources, configuring beans, or performing tasks at various stages of startup. By skipping `SpringApplication.run`, you miss out on these events.
   - **Custom Listeners**: Many Spring Boot applications use custom `ApplicationListener`s to perform tasks during these lifecycle events. Without them, some listeners won't be triggered, potentially leading to incomplete or incorrect application states at startup.

### 2. **Environment Configuration**

   - **Environment Preparation**: `SpringApplication.run` initializes and prepares the application environment, including property sources and profile activation, which might not be fully configured if you bypass it. This impacts access to configuration properties from application files (like `application.properties` or `application.yml`) and environment variables, making it difficult to control the application's behavior based on environments.
   - **Profiles and Property Sources**: Automatic activation of profiles and loading of property sources are features of `SpringApplication`. These would need to be handled manually without `SpringApplication.run`, making it cumbersome to set up the right configurations based on environments.

### 3. **Auto-Configuration**

   - **Missing Auto-Configuration**: Spring Boot’s auto-configuration, which is a key feature that simplifies setup by automatically configuring beans based on the dependencies in the classpath, relies on `SpringApplication.run`. Without it, you would need to configure components like DataSource, MVC, JPA, Security, etc., manually. This adds a significant amount of code and complexity, defeating the purpose of Spring Boot’s ease of use.
   - **Conditional Beans**: Many Spring Boot beans are conditional, meaning they are only configured if certain properties or dependencies are present. These conditions are evaluated during the `SpringApplication.run` phase. Without it, you might need to handle all conditions explicitly.

### 4. **Error Handling and Logging**

   - **Graceful Error Handling**: `SpringApplication.run` includes default error handling, displaying user-friendly error messages and hints when something goes wrong during startup. If you bypass this, error handling becomes less informative, potentially requiring additional code to handle exceptions properly.
   - **Startup Logs**: Spring Boot’s startup logs (e.g., displaying active profiles, configuration settings) are initialized by `SpringApplication.run`. Without it, you lose these helpful logs, making troubleshooting harder.

### 5. **Custom Initializers and Customizers**

   - **ApplicationContextInitializer**: `SpringApplication.run` can register multiple `ApplicationContextInitializer`s (like customizing the `ApplicationContext`) through its `contextInitializer` list, which would not happen automatically. If you bypass `SpringApplication.run`, you would need to manage this manually.
   - **SpringApplicationBuilder and Application Customizers**: The `SpringApplication` API includes support for customizing the application context and its environment through methods like `SpringApplicationBuilder` or setting `ApplicationContextCustomizer`s. Skipping `SpringApplication.run` omits these, which might limit flexibility if your application setup changes over time.

### 6. **Built-in Features and Defaults**

   - **Embedded Server Configuration**: For web applications, `SpringApplication.run` is responsible for starting the embedded web server (like Tomcat or Jetty). By bypassing it, you would need to set up and manage the server lifecycle manually, increasing complexity.
   - **Lazy Initialization and Additional Configurations**: With `SpringApplication.run`, you can control advanced configurations like lazy initialization, which reduces startup time by loading beans only when needed. These configurations are lost or require additional code without `SpringApplication.run`.

### Summary

Using `SpringApplication.contextInitializer` directly impacts many core features, making the setup process more complex and requiring more code. It removes the benefits of Spring Boot’s streamlined and convention-driven approach, which is designed to simplify development by automating many configuration aspects.

**Swapan**: give me some examples of difference in a code base when the app sarts with SpringApplication.contextInitializer  instead of SpringApplication.run

**ChatGPT**: Using `SpringApplication.contextInitializer` directly instead of `SpringApplication.run` in a Spring Boot application results in more verbose and complex code. Below are examples of code differences to illustrate the impact in key areas of the application.

### 1. **Application Setup**

When using `SpringApplication.run`, the typical Spring Boot application can look as simple as this:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }
}
```

However, if you bypass `SpringApplication.run` and use `ApplicationContextInitializer` directly, you’ll need to initialize the `ApplicationContext` manually and potentially set up each component that `SpringApplication.run` would have configured automatically.

Example:

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextInitializer;

public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
        context.register(MyConfig.class);
        context.refresh();

        // Manually apply any ApplicationContextInitializer logic
        new MyInitializer().initialize(context);

        // Manually start the application
        MyService myService = context.getBean(MyService.class);
        myService.start();
        
        // Add shutdown hook for proper shutdown
        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(context::close));
    }
}

class MyInitializer implements ApplicationContextInitializer<AnnotationConfigApplicationContext> {
    @Override
    public void initialize(AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context) {
        // Custom initialization logic
    }
}
```

In this approach, you have to register configurations, refresh the context, and add shutdown hooks manually, which `SpringApplication.run` would handle automatically.

### 2. **Configuration and Profiles**

With `SpringApplication.run`, profiles are managed easily using properties like `spring.profiles.active` in `application.properties`:

```properties
# application.properties
spring.profiles.active=dev
```

Using `ApplicationContextInitializer` directly requires you to configure profiles in code manually:

```java
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
context.getEnvironment().setActiveProfiles("dev");
context.register(MyConfig.class);
context.refresh();
```

This approach is less flexible, as environment-based configurations become more cumbersome.

### 3. **Auto-Configuration**

In Spring Boot, `SpringApplication.run` activates auto-configuration based on dependencies in the classpath. For example, if `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` is in your dependencies, Spring Boot will configure a `DataSource` automatically. You can simply inject it as follows:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {

    private final DataSource dataSource;

    @Autowired
    public MyService(DataSource dataSource) {
        this.dataSource = dataSource;
    }
}
```

With `ApplicationContextInitializer`, you lose auto-configuration, so you must manually define configurations, even for something as basic as a `DataSource`:

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource;

@Configuration
public class MyConfig {

    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        DriverManagerDataSource dataSource = new DriverManagerDataSource();
        dataSource.setDriverClassName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
        dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb");
        dataSource.setUsername("user");
        dataSource.setPassword("password");
        return dataSource;
    }
}
```

This significantly increases boilerplate, particularly if you rely on many auto-configured beans.

### 4. **Event Listeners**

With `SpringApplication.run`, you can add event listeners simply by implementing `ApplicationListener` or using annotations. For example:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.context.event.ApplicationReadyEvent;
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class StartupListener {

    @EventListener
    public void onApplicationReady(ApplicationReadyEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Application started successfully.");
    }
}
```

Without `SpringApplication.run`, you need to register events manually:

```java
context.addApplicationListener(new ApplicationListener<ApplicationReadyEvent>() {
    @Override
    public void onApplicationEvent(ApplicationReadyEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Application started successfully.");
    }
});
```

This approach makes code harder to maintain, especially as more events are added.

### 5. **Embedded Server Setup (for Web Applications)**

In a web application, `SpringApplication.run` will automatically set up an embedded server like Tomcat or Jetty. With `ApplicationContextInitializer`, however, you would need to set up and configure the server manually.

Using `SpringApplication.run`:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyWebApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyWebApp.class, args);
    }
}
```

With `ApplicationContextInitializer`:

```java
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
context.register(MyWebConfig.class);
context.refresh();

Tomcat tomcat = new Tomcat();
tomcat.setPort(8080);
// Additional Tomcat configuration...
tomcat.start();
```

The embedded server setup becomes more complex, requiring manual configuration and management.

### Summary

Using `SpringApplication.contextInitializer` instead of `SpringApplication.run` leads to a more verbose and complex codebase:

1. **Manual Application Context Management**: You need to create and refresh the context manually.
2. **Harder Configuration Management**: Manually configure profiles and environments.
3. **No Auto-Configuration**: Manually define all beans, increasing boilerplate code.
4. **Manual Event Listener Registration**: Need to add listeners explicitly.
5. **Manual Embedded Server Management**: Must manually configure an embedded server in web applications.

Overall, `SpringApplication.run` provides a streamlined, concise, and manageable approach that is well-suited for most Spring Boot applications, whereas using `contextInitializer` is more involved and primarily useful for specific advanced scenarios.
