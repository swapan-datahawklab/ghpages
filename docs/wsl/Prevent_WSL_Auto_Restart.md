**Swapan**: wsl --shutdown of ubuntu is temporary. Ubuntu doesnt stay down. How do i keep it from auto restarting?

**ChatGPT**: When you shut down a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) instance using the `wsl --shutdown` command, the instance is expected to stop running until a process or user action explicitly starts it again. However, if your Ubuntu instance restarts automatically, it could be due to one of the following reasons:

1. **Background Tasks or Services**: Some applications or services on your system may be configured to interact with WSL and start it.

2. **Windows Fast Startup**: If Fast Startup is enabled, it might cause WSL to restart when the system boots.

3. **Scheduled Tasks or Apps**: Certain scheduled tasks or apps (like Docker Desktop) might rely on WSL and trigger its startup.

---

### Steps to Prevent WSL from Restarting Automatically:

1. **Stop Docker Desktop (if installed)**:
   If you use Docker Desktop, it may start WSL automatically. Disable Docker from starting automatically at boot:
   - Open Docker Desktop settings.
   - Under "General," uncheck the option **"Start Docker Desktop when you log in."**

2. **Check for WSL-Dependent Apps or Services**:
   - Open the Task Manager (`Ctrl+Shift+Esc`).
   - Look for applications or processes that might use WSL and terminate them.

3. **Disable Automatic Startup Tasks**:
   - Open the `Task Scheduler`.
   - Check for tasks related to WSL or applications dependent on it, like Docker or other development tools.
   - Disable or adjust the triggers for these tasks.

4. **Disable Fast Startup** (if applicable):
   - Open the Control Panel and navigate to:
     `Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Power Options > Choose what the power buttons do.`
   - Click "Change settings that are currently unavailable."
   - Scroll down and uncheck **"Turn on fast startup (recommended)"**.
   - Click "Save changes."

5. **Set WSL Version to Manual**:
   WSL itself doesn't restart automatically unless triggered by a dependent application or process. However, you can ensure it's not triggered by running:
   ```bash
   sc config LxssManager start= demand
   ```
   This sets the `LxssManager` (the Windows service managing WSL) to start manually instead of automatically.

6. **Monitor Startup Behavior**:
   If you're unsure what's restarting WSL, monitor the processes:
   - Open `Event Viewer` (`Win + X > Event Viewer`).
   - Look for events related to WSL or `LxssManager`.

7. **Verify with Resource Monitor**:
   Use `Resource Monitor` to identify the processes interacting with your WSL filesystems. Kill those processes to prevent reactivation.

8. **Use WSL Configuration to Limit Instances**:
   Configure WSL to prevent Ubuntu from starting automatically:
   - Create or edit the file `%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig`.
   - Add the following:
     ```ini
     [boot]
     systemd=false
     ```
   - Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

Try these steps and monitor the behavior to ensure the Ubuntu instance stays shut down. Let me know if you need further clarification!

**ChatGPT**: By default, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) might automatically restart instances for certain operations. If you want to ensure that a specific Ubuntu instance in WSL does not automatically restart after a `wsl --shutdown`, you can take the following steps:

### **Option 1: Disable Automatic Background Processes**
1. **Check for Running Services in WSL**:
   - Some services, like Docker or other daemons, might trigger the restart. Stop these services first.
   - Use:
     ```bash
     sudo service <service_name> stop
     ```
     before shutting down WSL.

2. **Disable the Instance from Background Activities**:
   - Open your Ubuntu instance and configure `systemd` or other services to not start automatically.
   - For example:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl disable <service_name>
     ```

3. **Ensure No Tasks are Triggering Restart**:
   - Background tasks in Windows could relaunch WSL. Disable scheduled tasks or third-party applications that access WSL (e.g., Docker Desktop, VS Code).

---

### **Option 2: Configure WSL to Not Restart Automatically**
You can modify the WSL configuration file (`.wslconfig`) to adjust settings:
1. **Open or Create `.wslconfig`**:
   - Path: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.wslconfig`

2. **Add or Modify the Following**:
   ```ini
   [wsl2]
   autoShutdown=true
   ```

3. **Save the File and Restart WSL**:
   - Run:
     ```powershell
     wsl --shutdown
     ```

---

### **Option 3: Stop External Programs from Triggering WSL**
1. **Check Running Applications**:
   - Applications like Docker Desktop, VS Code, or others might be re-triggering the WSL Ubuntu instance. Temporarily close them.

2. **Disable Integration in Docker Desktop** (if applicable):
   - Open Docker Desktop > Settings > Resources > WSL Integration.
   - Disable Ubuntu from the integration list.

---

### **Option 4: Block WSL Processes (Extreme Case)**
If none of the above work and you want to prevent WSL from restarting completely:
1. **Open Task Manager**:
   - Look for `vmmem` or other WSL-related processes.

2. **Kill WSL-Related Processes**:
   - Find processes using Ubuntu or other WSL distributions and kill them manually.

3. **Block Restart (Temporary)**:
   - You can stop the `LxssManager` service (though this is not recommended as it disables WSL entirely):
     ```powershell
     Stop-Service LxssManager
     ```
     To re-enable:
     ```powershell
     Start-Service LxssManager
     ```

---

### **Option 5: Use Scripts to Control Shutdown**
You can create a script to ensure WSL stays down after a shutdown:
1. Create a PowerShell script:
   ```powershell
   wsl --shutdown
   Stop-Service LxssManager
   ```
2. Run the script when you want to ensure WSL does not restart.
