**Swapan**: oc get route to recreate create route command

**ChatGPT**: To recreate the `oc expose` command that created an OpenShift route from an existing route, you can use the `oc get route` command with the `-o yaml` or `-o json` option to view the route's details and construct the `oc expose` command accordingly.

Here’s how you can get the details of an existing route:

```bash
oc get route <route-name> -o yaml
```

This will give you the YAML representation of the route. The important fields you'll want to look for are:

- `host`: The route hostname.
- `path`: The path (if any) associated with the route.
- `to`: The service the route is exposing.
- `port`: The target port (if applicable).

To recreate the route, you can use the `oc expose` command, which looks something like this:

```bash
oc expose svc/<service-name> --hostname=<hostname> --port=<target-port>
```

For example, if your route's YAML output shows:

```yaml
spec:
  host: example.apps.openshift.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: my-service
  port:
    targetPort: 8080
```

The corresponding `oc expose` command to recreate the route might be:

```bash
oc expose svc/my-service --hostname=example.apps.openshift.com --port=8080
```

This will create a route exposing the service with the specified hostname and port.

**Swapan**: get route yaml without any added or managed fields

**ChatGPT**: To get a clean YAML output of a route without the extra metadata fields (like annotations, status, etc.) that are added or managed by OpenShift, you can filter the output using `kubectl` or `oc` with the `--export` flag (though this was deprecated in newer Kubernetes versions) or use tools like `jq` for JSON or custom filtering for YAML.

Here's a basic approach to get the essential fields using `oc get` combined with `yq` or by manually cleaning up the output.

### Using `oc get` and output clean YAML (manually)

First, get the YAML output of the route:

```bash
oc get route <route-name> -o yaml
```

You will need to manually remove the unnecessary sections like `status`, `metadata.managedFields`, `creationTimestamp`, `resourceVersion`, `uid`, and others that are not part of the essential route configuration.

### Using `yq` to filter the YAML

If you have `yq` installed, you can extract only the required fields like this:

```bash
oc get route <route-name> -o yaml | yq e 'del(.metadata.creationTimestamp, .metadata.managedFields, .metadata.resourceVersion, .metadata.uid, .metadata.selfLink, .status)' -
```

This will strip out metadata fields that are typically not needed for recreating the route.

### Using `jq` for JSON output

You can also get the route in JSON format and use `jq` to filter it. For example:

```bash
oc get route <route-name> -o json | jq 'del(.metadata.creationTimestamp, .metadata.managedFields, .metadata.resourceVersion, .metadata.uid, .metadata.selfLink, .status)'
```

This will give you a cleaned-up JSON representation of the route.

If you have specific fields you'd like to keep or remove, let me know, and I can adjust the command!

**Swapan**: use json parser built into oc

**ChatGPT**: To clean up the JSON output using the built-in JSONPath support in `oc`, you can extract only the relevant fields without the unnecessary metadata.

Here's how you can use `oc get` with JSONPath to extract the fields you care about:

```bash
oc get route <route-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec}'
```

This will give you only the `spec` section of the route, which contains the essential configuration details such as `host`, `to`, `port`, etc. If you want to include the `metadata.name` (the route's name), you can extend the JSONPath query:

```bash
oc get route <route-name> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{.spec}'
```

### Example Output

This command outputs just the essential fields like `metadata.name` and the `spec`, omitting unnecessary metadata like `managedFields`, `creationTimestamp`, etc.

This method leverages the JSONPath syntax built into `oc` and avoids the need for external tools like `jq` or `yq`. You can further adjust the JSONPath query based on the fields you're interested in.

**Swapan**: how to create a route from yaml file

**ChatGPT**: To create a route from a YAML file in OpenShift, you can use the `oc create -f` or `oc apply -f` command. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

### 1. Prepare the YAML File

Create a YAML file (e.g., `my-route.yaml`) with the route definition. Here's an example of what the YAML might look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-route
spec:
  host: my-app.apps.openshift.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: my-service
  port:
    targetPort: 8080
```

This YAML defines a route named `my-route` that exposes a service called `my-service` on the `8080` port, with the host `my-app.apps.openshift.com`.

### 2. Create the Route Using `oc create`

You can create the route using the following command:

```bash
oc create -f my-route.yaml
```

### 3. Alternatively, Use `oc apply`

The `oc apply` command is typically used when you want to create or update resources, so it's useful if the route might already exist and you want to ensure that it is updated if necessary:

```bash
oc apply -f my-route.yaml
```

### 4. Verify the Route

Once the route is created, you can verify it using:

```bash
oc get route my-route
```

This will show the details of the created route, including the `host` and service it’s routing traffic to.
