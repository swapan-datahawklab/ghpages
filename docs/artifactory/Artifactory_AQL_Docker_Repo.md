**Swapan**: describe in detail use of artifactory property @docker.repo in aql query

**ChatGPT**: **Understanding AQL and properties**

I’m digging into how AQL queries use properties like @docker.repo to access Docker images stored in Artifactory, and how these properties fit into the broader AQL query structure.

## Understanding @docker.repo in AQL queries

I'm thinking through how the @docker.repo property in Artifactory identifies the Docker repository for image layers and manifests. It's a useful tool when querying artifacts by this property.

**Breaking down the AQL syntax**

I’m examining how the @docker.repo property in Artifactory is used within AQL queries, including its role in identifying Docker repositories and specific examples for clarity.

**Understanding properties**

I’m learning about Artifactory's @docker.repo property, which stores Docker repository names. This helps efficiently manage and retrieve Docker images in queries.

**Locating Docker tags**

I’m piecing together the steps to pinpoint all tags of a Docker image named `my-app` by searching in `manifest.json` and including fields like `name` and `path`.

**Constructing complex queries**

Combining multiple property queries with logical operators like `$and` and `$or` deepens the search. Using standard operators like `$eq`, `$ne`, `$match`, `$nmatch`, `$in`, and `$nin` is also vital. This approach refines query effectiveness.

**ChatGPT**: **Understanding `@docker.repo` in Artifactory AQL Queries**

The `@docker.repo` property in Artifactory is automatically attached to Docker images and manifests stored within Artifactory's Docker repositories. This property represents the name of the Docker repository (equivalent to the image name in Docker terms) and can be leveraged in Artifactory Query Language (AQL) queries to search, retrieve, or manage Docker images based on their repository names.

**Why Use `@docker.repo`?**

- **Efficient Searching**: Quickly locate Docker images within Artifactory based on their repository names.
- **Automation**: Integrate AQL queries into scripts or CI/CD pipelines for automated management tasks.
- **Consistency**: Ensure you're querying against a reliable property that Artifactory maintains automatically.

---

### **Using `@docker.repo` in AQL Queries**

**Basic Structure of an AQL Query with Properties:**

```json
items.find({
    "property": {
        "key": "property_name",
        "value": "property_value"
    }
})
```

When querying with properties, the `property` domain is used, and properties are referenced using the `@` symbol. In the case of `@docker.repo`, it would be used to match Docker repository names.

---

### **Detailed Steps and Examples**

#### **1. Finding All Images in a Specific Docker Repository**

**Objective**: Retrieve all Docker images within Artifactory's Docker repository that belong to a specific Docker repository (e.g., `my-docker-repo`).

**AQL Query**:

```json
items.find({
    "repo": "your-artifactory-docker-repo",
    "type": "file",
    "name": "manifest.json",
    "property": {
        "$eq": {
            "@docker.repo": "my-docker-repo"
        }
    }
})
```

**Explanation**:

- `"repo"`: Specifies the Artifactory repository you're querying (e.g., `docker-local`).
- `"type": "file"`: Filters the results to files only.
- `"name": "manifest.json"`: Targets Docker image manifests.
- `"property"`: Utilizes the `@docker.repo` property to match the Docker repository name.

#### **2. Finding Images with a Specific Tag**

**Objective**: Retrieve Docker images that have a specific tag (e.g., `latest`).

**AQL Query**:

```json
items.find({
    "repo": "your-artifactory-docker-repo",
    "type": "file",
    "name": "manifest.json",
    "property": {
        "$and": [
            {
                "$eq": {
                    "@docker.repo": "my-docker-repo"
                }
            },
            {
                "$eq": {
                    "@docker.manifest": "latest"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
})
```

**Explanation**:

- Uses the logical `$and` operator to combine multiple property conditions.
- `"@docker.manifest"`: Property that holds the tag information.

#### **3. Listing All Repositories Matching a Pattern**

**Objective**: Find all Docker repositories whose names match a specific pattern (e.g., starting with `app-`).

**AQL Query**:

```json
items.find({
    "type": "file",
    "name": "manifest.json",
    "property": {
        "$match": {
            "@docker.repo": "app-*"
        }
    }
})
```

**Explanation**:

- The `$match` operator is used with wildcards (`*`) for pattern matching.

---

### **Advanced Usage**

#### **Combining Multiple Properties**

You can combine multiple property conditions using logical operators like `$and` and `$or`.

**Example**:

```json
items.find({
    "type": "file",
    "name": "manifest.json",
    "$and": [
        {
            "property": {
                "$eq": {
                    "@docker.repo": "my-docker-repo"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "property": {
                "$match": {
                    "@docker.manifest": "v1.*"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
})
```

**Explanation**:

- Retrieves images from `my-docker-repo` where the tag starts with `v1.`.

#### **Including Additional Fields**

Use the `.include()` function to retrieve additional information.

**Example**:

```json
items.find({
    "repo": "your-artifactory-docker-repo",
    "type": "file",
    "name": "manifest.json",
    "property": {
        "$eq": {
            "@docker.repo": "my-docker-repo"
        }
    }
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "created", "modified", "property")
```

**Explanation**:

- Includes fields like `created`, `modified`, and `property` in the results for more detailed information.

---

### **Running AQL Queries**

#### **Via REST API**

You can execute AQL queries by sending a POST request to the Artifactory API.

**Command**:

```bash
curl -u <username>:<password> -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -d '
items.find({
    // your query here
})
'
```

**Example**:

```bash
curl -u admin:password -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -d '
items.find({
    "repo": "docker-local",
    "type": "file",
    "name": "manifest.json",
    "property": {
        "$eq": {
            "@docker.repo": "my-docker-repo"
        }
    }
}).include("name", "path", "repo")
'
```

#### **Using Artifactory's AQL Editor**

If you have access to the Artifactory UI:

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Advanced** > **AQL**.
2. Enter your AQL query in the editor.
3. Execute the query and view the results directly in the UI.

---

### **Understanding the Storage Structure**

Artifactory stores Docker images in a specific hierarchy:

- **Repository**: The Artifactory repository (e.g., `docker-local`).
- **Path**: Includes the Docker repository name and tag (e.g., `my-docker-repo/latest`).
- **Name**: The file name (e.g., `manifest.json`).

**Properties Attached**:

- `@docker.repo`: The Docker repository name.
- `@docker.manifest`: The tag name.
- Other Docker-related properties.

---

### **Best Practices**

- **Specify Repositories**: Always include the `"repo"` field to limit the scope of your query.
- **Use Properties**: Rely on properties like `@docker.repo` for consistent and reliable querying.
- **Include Necessary Fields**: Use `.include()` to retrieve all the fields you need, reducing the amount of data transferred.
- **Test Queries**: Before integrating queries into scripts or applications, test them using the AQL editor or via the API.

---

### **Common Operators in AQL**

- **`$eq`**: Equal to.
- **`$ne`**: Not equal to.
- **`$match`**: Matches a pattern (supports wildcards `*` and `?`).
- **`$nmatch`**: Does not match a pattern.
- **`$in`**: In a list of values.
- **`$nin`**: Not in a list of values.
- **`$lt`**, **`$lte`**: Less than, less than or equal to.
- **`$gt`**, **`$gte`**: Greater than, greater than or equal to.

---

### **Conclusion**

Using the `@docker.repo` property in your AQL queries allows for powerful and precise control over Docker images stored in Artifactory. By understanding how to construct these queries and utilizing the properties attached to artifacts, you can effectively manage and automate tasks involving Docker images.

**Swapan**: describe in detail use of artifactory property @docker.repoName in aql query

**ChatGPT**: **Understanding Artifactory**

OK, let's break this down: Artifactory is a repository manager for binaries, while AQL is its query language. Docker repositories within Artifactory store Docker images, and artifacts can have properties like '@docker.repoName' to indicate repository names.

**Focusing on Docker repositories**

I’m piecing together the use of the `@docker.repoName` property in AQL queries to pinpoint Docker images by their repository names in Artifactory. This involves understanding Docker image properties and leveraging AQL's querying capabilities.

**Constructing AQL Queries**

I'm thinking through how to use AQL queries in Artifactory to track Docker images by their `@docker.repoName` property, enabling efficient artifact management within specified repositories.

**Formulating AQL queries**

I’m pulling together AQL queries to find artifacts in a Docker repository by matching specific properties, utilizing wildcards and regular expressions for flexible matching.

**Filtering specific artifacts**

I'm working through filtering artifacts by Docker repository and tag using JSON search syntax, including practical use cases and potential caveats.

**ChatGPT**: **Using the `@docker.repoName` Property in Artifactory AQL Queries**

**Introduction**

Artifactory Query Language (AQL) is a powerful tool provided by JFrog Artifactory to search and retrieve artifacts based on various criteria. When working with Docker repositories in Artifactory, the `@docker.repoName` property becomes particularly useful. This property represents the Docker repository name associated with an artifact, mirroring the repository structure in Docker.

This guide will explain in detail how to utilize the `@docker.repoName` property in your AQL queries to effectively search for Docker images and tags within Artifactory.

---

**Understanding the `@docker.repoName` Property**

In Artifactory, when Docker images are pushed to a Docker repository, Artifactory automatically assigns specific properties to the artifacts for metadata purposes. The `@docker.repoName` property holds the value of the Docker repository name as it appears in Docker commands (e.g., `docker pull myregistry/myimage`).

For instance, if you push an image with the repository name `myregistry/myimage`, the `@docker.repoName` property for the corresponding artifact in Artifactory will be `myregistry/myimage`.

---

**Constructing AQL Queries with `@docker.repoName`**

To query artifacts based on the `@docker.repoName` property, you need to include it in the `property` section of your AQL query. Below are steps and examples to guide you through this process.

**1. Basic Query Structure**

An AQL query targeting the `@docker.repoName` property typically follows this structure:

```json
items.find({
  "repo": "your-docker-repo",
  "property": {
    "$eq": {
      "key": "@docker.repoName",
      "value": "your-docker-repo-name"
    }
  }
})
```

**2. Querying for a Specific Docker Repository Name**

To find all artifacts associated with a specific Docker repository name:

```json
items.find({
  "repo": "docker-local",
  "property": {
    "$eq": {
      "key": "@docker.repoName",
      "value": "myregistry/myimage"
    }
  }
})
```

**Explanation:**

- `"repo": "docker-local"` specifies the Artifactory repository to search within.
- The `property` section filters artifacts where the property key is `@docker.repoName` and the value is `myregistry/myimage`.

**3. Using Wildcards with the `$match` Operator**

If you want to search for all repositories that match a certain pattern, you can use the `$match` operator with wildcards:

```json
items.find({
  "repo": "docker-local",
  "property": {
    "$match": {
      "key": "@docker.repoName",
      "value": "myregistry/*"
    }
  }
})
```

**Note:** The wildcard `*` matches any sequence of characters.

**4. Combining Multiple Conditions**

You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `$and`, `$or`, and `$not`. For example, to find artifacts with a specific `@docker.repoName` and a specific tag:

```json
items.find({
  "repo": "docker-local",
  "$and": [
    {
      "property": {
        "$eq": {
          "key": "@docker.repoName",
          "value": "myregistry/myimage"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "property": {
        "$eq": {
          "key": "docker.manifest",
          "value": "latest"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

---

**Advanced Query Examples**

**Example 1: Retrieving All Tags for a Docker Image**

To get all tags associated with a Docker image:

```json
items.find({
  "repo": "docker-local",
  "property": {
    "$eq": {
      "key": "@docker.repoName",
      "value": "myregistry/myimage"
    }
  }
}).include("name", "property")
```

**Explanation:**

- The `include("name", "property")` function specifies that the output should include the artifact's name and properties.

**Example 2: Finding Images Not Tagged as 'latest'**

To find all artifacts where the tag is not `latest`:

```json
items.find({
  "repo": "docker-local",
  "$and": [
    {
      "property": {
        "$eq": {
          "key": "@docker.repoName",
          "value": "myregistry/myimage"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "property": {
        "$ne": {
          "key": "docker.manifest",
          "value": "latest"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

**Example 3: Searching Using Regular Expressions**

To use regular expressions for more complex matching:

```json
items.find({
  "repo": "docker-local",
  "property": {
    "$match": {
      "key": "@docker.repoName",
      "value": {"$regex": "myregistry/.*service"}
    }
  }
})
```

**Explanation:**

- The `"$regex": "myregistry/.*service"` pattern matches any repository name that starts with `myregistry/` and ends with `service`.

---

**Best Practices and Considerations**

- **Property Indexing:** For improved performance, ensure that the properties you're querying (e.g., `@docker.repoName`) are indexed in Artifactory.
- **Case Sensitivity:** Property keys and values in AQL queries are case-sensitive. Ensure you use the exact casing as stored in Artifactory.
- **Permissions:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the repositories and artifacts you're querying.
- **Testing Queries:** It's advisable to test your queries with limited scope (e.g., a specific repository or artifact) before running them on a broader scale.

---

**Using AQL Queries via the REST API**

You can execute AQL queries through Artifactory's REST API by sending a POST request to the `/api/search/aql` endpoint. Here's how you can do it:

**Request:**

```bash
curl -u username:password -X POST "http://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d 'YOUR_AQL_QUERY'
```

**Example:**

```bash
curl -u admin:password -X POST "http://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '
items.find({
  "repo": "docker-local",
  "property": {
    "$eq": {
      "key": "@docker.repoName",
      "value": "myregistry/myimage"
    }
  }
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
'
```

**Response:**

The response will be a JSON object containing the list of artifacts that match the query criteria, including the specified fields.

---

**Conclusion**

The `@docker.repoName` property is a powerful attribute for querying Docker artifacts in Artifactory. By incorporating this property into your AQL queries, you can efficiently search for Docker images and tags, perform bulk operations, and manage your Docker repositories more effectively.

**ChatGPT**: **Retrieving All Artifactory Docker Properties**

---

**Introduction**

JFrog Artifactory automatically assigns several properties to Docker artifacts, providing valuable metadata about Docker images, such as repository names, image IDs, labels, manifest digests, and more. These properties are essential for managing Docker images and can be retrieved using the Artifactory Query Language (AQL).

This guide will explain how to return all Docker properties from Artifactory using AQL queries, ensuring you can access and utilize this metadata effectively.

---

**Understanding Docker Properties in Artifactory**

Before crafting queries, it's important to know the common Docker properties that Artifactory assigns to Docker artifacts:

- `docker.repoName`: The name of the Docker repository.
- `docker.manifest`: The tag associated with the Docker image.
- `docker.manifest.digest`: The digest of the Docker manifest.
- `docker.imageId`: The unique identifier of the Docker image.
- `docker.layers`: A list of layers that compose the Docker image.
- `docker.label.<label_name>`: Any labels applied to the Docker image.
- `docker.config.*`: Configuration details of the Docker image.

---

**Retrieving All Docker Properties Using AQL**

To retrieve all Docker properties, you'll need to execute an AQL query that targets Docker artifacts and includes their properties in the results.

**1. Basic AQL Query to Retrieve Docker Artifacts with Properties**

```json
items.find({
  "property.key": { "$match": "docker.repoName" }
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

**Explanation:**

- **"property.key": { "$match": "docker.repoName" }**: Filters artifacts to those that have the `docker.repoName` property, ensuring you're only dealing with Docker artifacts.
- **.include("name", "repo", "path", "property")**: Includes the artifact's name, repository, path, and all associated properties in the output.

**2. Retrieving Docker Properties from a Specific Repository**

If you want to limit the query to a specific Docker repository:

```json
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "repo": "your-docker-repo-name" },
    { "property.key": { "$match": "docker.repoName" } }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

**Replace** `"your-docker-repo-name"` with the name of your Docker repository.

**3. Retrieving Specific Docker Properties**

To retrieve specific Docker properties, such as `docker.imageId` and `docker.manifest.digest`, modify the include clause:

```json
items.find({
  "property.key": { "$match": "docker.repoName" }
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

After executing the query, you can filter the properties in your application or script to display only the desired ones.

---

**Executing the AQL Query**

You can execute the AQL query via the Artifactory REST API.

**Using cURL:**

```bash
curl -u username:password -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '

        { "key": "docker.layers", "value": "[\"sha256:...\",\"sha256:...\"]" },
        // Additional properties
      ]
    },
    // Additional artifacts
  ]
}
```

**Note:** The `properties` array includes all the Docker properties associated with each artifact.

---

**Listing All Docker Properties Keys**

If you want to retrieve a list of all unique Docker property keys used in Artifactory:

**1. Querying the `properties` Domain**

```json
props.find({
  "key": { "$match": "docker.*" }
}).include("key").distinct()
```

**Explanation:**

- **props.find**: Queries the properties domain instead of items.
- **"key": { "$match": "docker.*" }**: Filters properties with keys starting with `docker.`.
- **.include("key").distinct()**: Includes only the property keys and removes duplicates.

**2. Executing the Properties Query**

**Using cURL:**

```bash
curl -u username:password -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '
props.find({
  "key": { "$match": "docker.*" }
}).include("key").distinct()
'
```

**Response:**

You'll receive a list of unique Docker property keys.

---

**Retrieving Docker Properties for a Specific Image or Tag**

To get all Docker properties for a specific image or tag:

```json
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "repo": "your-docker-repo-name" },
    { "path": { "$match": "*your-image-name*" } },
    { "property.key": { "$match": "docker.repoName" } }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

**Replace**:

- `"your-docker-repo-name"` with your Docker repository name.
- `"*your-image-name*"` with your Docker image name (use wildcards if necessary).

---

**Advanced Queries**

**1. Filtering by Specific Docker Property Values**

If you need to retrieve artifacts where a Docker property has a specific value:

```json
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "repo": "your-docker-repo-name" },
    { "property": { "$eq": { "key": "docker.manifest", "value": "latest" } } }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

**Explanation:**

- **"property": { "$eq": { "key": "docker.manifest", "value": "latest" } }**: Filters artifacts where the `docker.manifest` property equals `latest`.

**2. Retrieving Artifacts with Specific Labels**

If you want to find Docker images with a specific label:

```json
items.find({
  "property.key": { "$match": "docker.label.*" }
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

**Or to filter by a specific label and value:**

```json
items.find({
  "property": { "$eq": { "key": "docker.label.your_label", "value": "your_value" } }
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

**Replace**:

- `"your_label"` with the label name.
- `"your_value"` with the label value.

---

**Using the Artifactory UI**

If you prefer using the Artifactory UI:

1. **Navigate to the Artifact Browser**: Go to the repository containing your Docker images.
2. **Search for Artifacts**: Use the search bar to filter artifacts.
3. **View Properties**: Click on an artifact to view its details, including properties, in the right-hand pane.

**Note:** The UI does not support displaying all properties for all artifacts at once, so using AQL via the REST API is more efficient for bulk retrieval.

---

**Best Practices**

- **Property Indexing**: Ensure that the properties you're querying are indexed for optimal performance.
- **Authentication**: Use API keys or tokens instead of username and password when possible, for better security.
- **Data Handling**: Be cautious when handling large datasets; consider pagination or processing results in batches.
- **Security Permissions**: Make sure your user account has the necessary permissions to access the repositories and artifacts you're querying.

---

**Conclusion**

By utilizing AQL queries, you can effectively retrieve all Docker properties from Artifactory. This capability allows you to manage Docker images more efficiently, automate processes, and integrate with other tools or systems as needed.

**Swapan**: how about returning all custom aftifactory docker image properties

**ChatGPT**: **Noticing custom attributes**

OK, let me see. I’m gathering info on how to list all custom attributes assigned to Docker images in Artifactory, distinct from automatic ones like docker.repoName and docker.manifest.

**Crafting the approach**

I’m developing a plan to query custom properties for Docker images in Artifactory using AQL, ensuring to exclude the standard Docker properties. This involves identifying and retrieving all custom properties associated with Docker images.

**Crafting the AQL query**

I’m thinking through an AQL query to retrieve artifacts. By focusing on Docker images and filtering out standard Docker properties, I aim to isolate unique ones.

**Pulling together custom properties**

I’m gathering info on retrieving custom properties for Docker images in Artifactory. This involves AQL queries, excluding standard properties, and using the REST API for execution.

**Retrieving custom properties**

OK, let me see. I’m setting up a configuration to retrieve all custom Artifactory Docker image properties, which are flexible key-value pairs for detailed metadata management.

**Listing and retrieving**

OK, let me see. This guide details identifying Docker artifacts in Artifactory, noting their standard and custom properties. Custom properties are user-defined, and the focus is on retrieving these specific ones.

**Uncovering Docker Artifacts**

I’m building an AQL query to pinpoint Docker artifacts using the `docker.repoName` property. This reveals custom properties by excluding those that start with `docker.`.

**Filtering traits**

I'm thinking about altering the AQL query to exclude properties starting with `docker.`, as AQL's `include` clause doesn't support negative matches. This approach should help narrow down the results efficiently.

**Navigating Docker properties**

I’m figuring out which Docker artifacts I can search and how to filter out standard properties for more focused results. This involves custom AQL queries and possibly programming.

**Refining AQL Queries**

I’m pulling together Artifactory's AQL operators to refine queries for custom properties, focusing on `$nmatch` for specific key exclusions. This involves crafting detailed examples and executing via REST API.

**ChatGPT**: **Retrieving All Custom Artifactory Docker Image Properties**

---

**Introduction**

In JFrog Artifactory, custom properties are user-defined metadata that you can assign to artifacts, including Docker images. These properties can help with categorization, filtering, and automation processes. Unlike standard Docker properties (e.g., `docker.repoName`, `docker.manifest`), custom properties have keys and values defined by you, tailored to your organization's needs.

This guide explains how to retrieve all custom properties assigned to Docker images in Artifactory using the Artifactory Query Language (AQL).

---

**Understanding Custom Properties and Docker Artifacts**

**Standard Docker Properties**

Artifactory automatically assigns several properties to Docker artifacts:

- `docker.repoName`
- `docker.manifest`
- `docker.manifest.digest`
- `docker.imageId`
- `docker.layers`
- `docker.label.<label_name>`
- `docker.config.*`

**Custom Properties**

Custom properties are those you've added manually or via automation, with keys that **do not start with `docker.`** These properties can include any metadata you find useful, such as:

- `environment`: e.g., `production`, `staging`
- `department`: e.g., `IT`, `Marketing`
- `version`: e.g., `1.0.0`, `2.1.3`

---

**Objective**

Retrieve all custom properties (excluding standard Docker properties) assigned to Docker images stored in Artifactory.

---

**Crafting the AQL Query**

To achieve this, we'll:

1. **Identify Docker Artifacts**: Find artifacts that are Docker images.
2. **Exclude Standard Docker Properties**: Filter out properties that start with `docker.`.
3. **Retrieve Custom Properties**: Return the remaining properties associated with those artifacts.

**AQL Query to Retrieve Custom Properties**

```json
properties.find({
  "$and": [
    { "item.property.key": { "$eq": "docker.repoName" } },
    { "key": { "$nmatch": "docker.*" } }
  ]
}).include("key", "value", "item.repo", "item.path", "item.name")
```

**Explanation:**

- **`properties.find`**: Searches in the properties domain.
- **`"item.property.key": { "$eq": "docker.repoName" }`**: Ensures the artifact is a Docker image by checking for the `docker.repoName` property.
- **`"key": { "$nmatch": "docker.*" }`**: Filters out properties where the key starts with `docker.` (i.e., excludes standard Docker properties).
- **`.include(...)`**: Specifies the fields to include in the output.

---

**Executing the AQL Query via REST API**

You can run this query using Artifactory's REST API with a `POST` request to the `/api/search/aql` endpoint.

**Using cURL:**

```bash
curl -u username:password -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '
properties.find({
  "$and": [
    { "item.property.key": { "$eq": "docker.repoName" } },
    { "key": { "$nmatch": "docker.*" } }
  ]
}).include("key", "value", "item.repo", "item.path", "item.name")
'
```

**Replace**:

- `username:password` with your Artifactory credentials or use an API key/token.
- `https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory` with your Artifactory URL.

---

**Sample Response Structure**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "key": "environment",
      "value": "production",
      "item": {
        "repo": "docker-local",
        "path": "myapp/latest",
        "name": "manifest.json"
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "department",
      "value": "IT",
      "item": {
        "repo": "docker-local",
        "path": "myapp/v1.0",
        "name": "manifest.json"
      }
    },
    // Additional properties
  ],
  "range": {
    "start_pos": 0,
    "end_pos": 2,
    "total": 2
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`results`**: An array of custom properties associated with Docker images.
- **`key` and `value`**: The custom property's key and value.
- **`item`**: Information about the Docker artifact the property is attached to.

---

**Filtering for Specific Repositories or Images**

You can modify the query to target specific repositories or images.

**For a Specific Repository:**

```json
properties.find({
  "$and": [
    { "item.repo": "your-docker-repo-name" },
    { "item.property.key": { "$eq": "docker.repoName" } },
    { "key": { "$nmatch": "docker.*" } }
  ]
}).include("key", "value", "item.repo", "item.path", "item.name")
```

**For a Specific Docker Image:**

```json
properties.find({
  "$and": [
    { "item.property": { "$eq": { "key": "docker.repoName", "value": "your/image:name" } } },
    { "key": { "$nmatch": "docker.*" } }
  ]
}).include("key", "value", "item.repo", "item.path", "item.name")
```

**Replace**:

- `"your-docker-repo-name"` with your repository's name.
- `"your/image:name"` with the specific Docker image name.

---

**Considerations**

- **Permissions**: Ensure your user has the necessary permissions to read properties and artifacts in the repositories.
- **Property Indexing**: For optimal performance, verify that properties are indexed in Artifactory.
- **Large Data Sets**: If dealing with many artifacts, consider adding pagination to your query.

---

**Alternative Approach: Filtering After Retrieval**

If the AQL limitations prevent you from excluding properties directly, retrieve all properties and filter out standard ones in your application or script.

**AQL Query:**

```json
items.find({
  "property.key": { "$eq": "docker.repoName" }
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

**Post-Processing:**

- Loop through each item's properties.
- Exclude properties where the key starts with `docker.`.

**Example in Python:**

```python
import requests

# Execute the AQL query
response = requests.post(
    'https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql',
    auth=('username', 'password'),
    headers={'Content-Type': 'text/plain'},
    data="""
    items.find({
      "property.key": { "$eq": "docker.repoName" }
    }).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
    """
)

data = response.json()

# Process results
for item in data['results']:
    custom_properties = [
        prop for prop in item.get('properties', [])
        if not prop['key'].startswith('docker.')
    ]
    if custom_properties:
        print(f"Artifact: {item['repo']}/{item['path']}/{item['name']}")
        for prop in custom_properties:
            print(f"  {prop['key']}: {prop['value']}")
```

---

**Best Practices**

- **Security**: Use API keys or tokens instead of username/password where possible.
- **Efficiency**: Limit your queries to necessary repositories or artifacts to reduce load.
- **Testing**: Test queries in a development environment before running them in production.

---

**Conclusion**

By following the steps above, you can effectively retrieve all custom properties assigned to Docker images in Artifactory. This allows you to leverage metadata for better artifact management and integration with other systems.

**ChatGPT**: **Retrieving All Custom Artifactory Docker Image Properties**

If you want to return only custom properties associated with Docker images in Artifactory—i.e., those properties added manually or by scripts rather than the default properties (`docker.repoName`, `docker.manifest`, etc.)—you need to perform some filtering to distinguish between built-in Docker properties and custom properties.

This guide provides ways to return all custom properties of Docker images using Artifactory Query Language (AQL).

---

### Step-by-Step Approach to Retrieve Custom Docker Properties

#### 1. Understand the Difference Between Default and Custom Properties

- **Default Docker Properties**: Properties such as `docker.repoName`, `docker.manifest`, `docker.manifest.digest`, etc., are automatically set by Artifactory when you push Docker images to a repository.
- **Custom Properties**: Properties manually added by users or automation scripts (e.g., `team`, `environment`, `buildVersion`) are what you want to retrieve specifically.

The key here is that custom properties typically do not follow the reserved Docker property naming conventions like `docker.*`.

---

#### 2. Use AQL to Find Artifacts with Properties

To retrieve all properties associated with Docker images but to filter out the default ones, you can use a combination of AQL querying and filtering logic.

##### **Example AQL to Retrieve All Properties**

This AQL will retrieve all Docker artifacts along with their properties:

```json
items.find({
  "property.key": { "$match": "docker.repoName" }
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

In this query:
- `"property.key": { "$match": "docker.repoName" }` ensures we are only fetching Docker images.
- `.include("name", "repo", "path", "property")` fetches all properties of these Docker images.

##### **Filter Out Default Properties**

To get only custom properties, you will need to perform a post-processing step. Below are two methods you can use:

1. **Post-Processing Using Scripts**

   After retrieving all properties, you can use a script to filter out the default properties like `docker.repoName`, `docker.manifest`, `docker.manifest.digest`, etc.

   For example, using a Python script:

   ```python
   import requests
   import json

   # Fetch all Docker artifacts with properties using AQL via the REST API
   url = "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql"
   headers = {"Content-Type": "text/plain"}
   auth = ("username", "password")

   # AQL to find all Docker artifacts and include properties
   aql_query = '''
   items.find({
     "property.key": { "$match": "docker.repoName" }
   }).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
   '''

   response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=aql_query, auth=auth)
   data = response.json()

   # List of default properties to exclude
   default_properties = [
       "docker.repoName", "docker.manifest", "docker.manifest.digest",
       "docker.imageId", "docker.layers", "docker.label.*", "docker.config.*"
   ]

   # Extract custom properties
   for item in data["results"]:
       custom_properties = [
           prop for prop in item.get("properties", [])
           if not any(prop["key"].startswith(default) for default in default_properties)
       ]
       print(f"Artifact: {item['name']}, Custom Properties: {custom_properties}")
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - The AQL query fetches all properties for Docker images.
   - The Python script then filters out any properties that start with `docker.` or match the known default properties.

2. **Using AQL to Filter Custom Properties Directly**

   You can modify the AQL query to exclude the default properties directly. For example:

   ```json
   items.find({
     "$and": [
       { "property.key": { "$match": "docker.repoName" } },
       { "property.key": { "$nmatch": "docker.*" } }
     ]
   }).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - The `$and` condition ensures that we are selecting Docker artifacts.
   - `{ "property.key": { "$nmatch": "docker.*" } }` excludes any properties that start with `docker.`, effectively leaving only custom properties.

---

### Executing the AQL Query via REST API

You can execute the AQL query via Artifactory’s REST API.

**Example Using `curl`**:

```bash
curl -u username:password -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "property.key": { "$match": "docker.repoName" } },
    { "property.key": { "$nmatch": "docker.*" } }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
'
```

This query will return a list of artifacts and their custom properties in JSON format.

---

### Listing All Custom Properties Keys

If you only need to know the keys of custom properties associated with Docker images, you can use the `props` domain in AQL to filter for non-default properties.

**Example AQL Query for Custom Property Keys**:

```json
props.find({
  "$and": [
    { "key": { "$match": "*" } },
    { "key": { "$nmatch": "docker.*" } }
  ]
}).include("key").distinct()
```

**Explanation**:
- The `props.find()` query fetches all property keys.
- `{ "$nmatch": "docker.*" }` excludes default Docker properties.

**Example Using `curl`**:

```bash
curl -u username:password -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '
props.find({
  "$and": [
    { "key": { "$match": "*" } },
    { "key": { "$nmatch": "docker.*" } }
  ]
}).include("key").distinct()
'
```

This query will return all unique custom property keys used in Artifactory.

---

### Using the Artifactory UI to View Custom Properties

If you prefer using the Artifactory UI:

1. **Navigate to the Artifact Browser**:
   - Go to the Docker repository containing your images.
  
2. **Search and View Properties**:
   - Use the search bar to find specific images.
   - Click on an image to see its properties in the right-hand pane.
   - Identify the custom properties by distinguishing them from standard Docker properties (they won’t start with `docker.`).

**Note**: The Artifactory UI does not allow you to search explicitly for custom properties. AQL via the REST API is more suitable for that.

---

### Conclusion

To retrieve all custom properties of Docker images in Artifactory, you can:

- Use AQL queries to fetch all properties and filter out default properties either by using custom scripts or by modifying the AQL query.
- Post-process the results to extract only non-default properties.
- Alternatively, use the Artifactory UI to view properties on a per-artifact basis.

This approach allows you to effectively manage metadata that is specific to your organization’s needs, facilitating better image categorization, automation, and reporting.

**Swapan**: aql query for custom manifest.json artifactory property

**ChatGPT**: To create an Artifactory Query Language (AQL) query that targets a custom property specifically assigned to `manifest.json` files in Docker repositories, you can use the following structure. This will help you find artifacts of type `manifest.json` and filter based on your custom property.

### Understanding the Manifest File in Artifactory
In Docker repositories, the `manifest.json` file is crucial as it contains metadata about a specific Docker image, including information on layers, configuration, and tags. You may have added custom properties to these files for organizational or metadata purposes, such as build metadata, environment information, or other tags.

### Example AQL Query for `manifest.json` with a Custom Property
Here's how to create an AQL query that specifically retrieves all `manifest.json` files with a custom property:

```json
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "name": "manifest.json" },
    { "repo": "your-docker-repository" },
    { "property": { "$eq": { "key": "custom.property.key", "value": "desired_value" } } }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

#### Explanation
- `"name": "manifest.json"`: Targets files with the name `manifest.json`, which are the Docker manifest files.
- `"repo": "your-docker-repository"`: Specify the name of the Docker repository you want to search in. Replace `"your-docker-repository"` with the actual repository name.
- `"property": { "$eq": { "key": "custom.property.key", "value": "desired_value" } }`: Filters artifacts to return only those with a custom property key named `custom.property.key` and a value of `"desired_value"`. Replace `custom.property.key` and `desired_value` with the key and value of the property you are interested in.
- `.include("name", "repo", "path", "property")`: Specifies the fields to include in the output. This example includes the artifact name, repository, path, and properties.

### Query for All `manifest.json` Files with Any Custom Property
If you want to list all `manifest.json` files that have **any custom property** without filtering by a specific key/value, you can modify the query as follows:

```json
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "name": "manifest.json" },
    { "repo": "your-docker-repository" },
    { "property.key": { "$nmatch": "docker.*" } }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

#### Explanation
- `{ "property.key": { "$nmatch": "docker.*" } }`: Excludes any property that starts with `docker.` to ensure that you're getting only custom properties, as built-in Docker properties typically start with `"docker."`.

### Executing the AQL Query via REST API
You can execute the AQL query through Artifactory’s REST API.

#### Example Using cURL:
```bash
curl -u username:password -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "name": "manifest.json" },
    { "repo": "your-docker-repository" },
    { "property": { "$eq": { "key": "custom.property.key", "value": "desired_value" } } }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
'
```
Replace the following:
- `username:password` with your Artifactory credentials.
- `"your-docker-repository"` with the name of your Docker repository.
- `"custom.property.key"` and `"desired_value"` with the actual property key and value you are interested in.

### Finding All `manifest.json` Files with Any Property
To get all `manifest.json` files with any properties (custom or default):

```json
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "name": "manifest.json" },
    { "repo": "your-docker-repository" },
    { "property.key": { "$match": "*" } }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

### Example Response
The response will include all artifacts that match the criteria, including their properties. Here is an example of what the response might look like:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "repo": "docker-local",
      "path": "myimage/1.0",
      "name": "manifest.json",
      "properties": [
        { "key": "custom.property.key", "value": "desired_value" },
        { "key": "another.custom.key", "value": "another_value" }
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Conclusion
The above AQL queries allow you to effectively search for Docker `manifest.json` files with custom properties in Artifactory. You can either target specific custom properties or retrieve all custom properties assigned to these manifest files.

**Key Points:**
- Use `"name": "manifest.json"` to target manifest files specifically.
- Use filtering conditions like `"$nmatch": "docker.*"` to exclude default Docker properties.
- Run these AQL queries via the Artifactory REST API to get results in JSON format, which can then be processed programmatically.

**Swapan**: how do i search a specific registry in a local docker repo

**ChatGPT**: To search for a specific registry in a local Docker repository in JFrog Artifactory using AQL, you need to target the specific Docker repository (`repo`), and filter by the Docker repository name (`@docker.repoName`). The `@docker.repoName` property is the key to identifying images by their full registry and image name, such as `myregistry/myimage`.

Below, I'll guide you through how to construct an AQL query to search for a specific registry and image within a local Docker repository.

### Understanding the Structure of Docker Repositories
In Artifactory, Docker repositories are structured in a way that represents Docker registries and images. For example:

- Registry name: `myregistry`
- Image name: `myregistry/myimage`

The Artifactory property `@docker.repoName` stores the full name of the Docker repository, making it a convenient attribute for searching.

### Example AQL Query to Search for a Specific Registry in a Local Docker Repository

To search for a specific registry in a Docker repository, you can use an AQL query like this:

```json
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "repo": "docker-local" },
    { "property": { "$eq": { "key": "@docker.repoName", "value": "myregistry/myimage" } } }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

#### Explanation:
- `"repo": "docker-local"`: This specifies the Docker repository where you want to search. Replace `"docker-local"` with the name of your local Docker repository.
- `"property": { "$eq": { "key": "@docker.repoName", "value": "myregistry/myimage" } }`: This filters results based on the `@docker.repoName` property, which matches the full name of the Docker image. Replace `"myregistry/myimage"` with your specific registry and image name.
- `.include("name", "repo", "path", "property")`: This line specifies the fields you want to include in the output, such as the artifact's name, repository, path, and properties.

### Example AQL Query for Searching Only by Registry Name
If you want to search for all images associated with a specific registry (i.e., not specifying a particular image name), you can use a wildcard match:

```json
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "repo": "docker-local" },
    { "property": { "$match": { "key": "@docker.repoName", "value": "myregistry/*" } } }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

#### Explanation:
- `"property": { "$match": { "key": "@docker.repoName", "value": "myregistry/*" } }`: This uses a wildcard (`*`) to match any image within the `myregistry` registry.

### Executing the AQL Query via REST API
You can execute the AQL query through Artifactory's REST API to get the results programmatically.

#### Example Using `curl`:
```bash
curl -u username:password -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "repo": "docker-local" },
    { "property": { "$eq": { "key": "@docker.repoName", "value": "myregistry/myimage" } } }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
'
```
Replace the following:
- `username:password`: Your Artifactory credentials.
- `https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory`: The URL to your Artifactory instance.
- `"docker-local"`: Your Docker repository name.
- `"myregistry/myimage"`: The specific registry/image you are searching for.

### Example Response Structure
The response from Artifactory will be in JSON format and might look like this:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "repo": "docker-local",
      "path": "myregistry/myimage/1.0",
      "name": "manifest.json",
      "properties": [
        { "key": "@docker.repoName", "value": "myregistry/myimage" },
        { "key": "docker.manifest", "value": "1.0" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "repo": "docker-local",
      "path": "myregistry/myimage/1.1",
      "name": "manifest.json",
      "properties": [
        { "key": "@docker.repoName", "value": "myregistry/myimage" },
        { "key": "docker.manifest", "value": "1.1" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Searching by Tags
If you want to search for a specific tag of an image in a registry, you can extend your AQL query to include the tag property. For instance:

```json
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "repo": "docker-local" },
    { "property": { "$eq": { "key": "@docker.repoName", "value": "myregistry/myimage" } } },
    { "property": { "$eq": { "key": "docker.manifest", "value": "latest" } } }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
```

#### Explanation:
- The additional condition `{ "property": { "$eq": { "key": "docker.manifest", "value": "latest" } } }` filters for the specific tag (`latest`).

### Using the Artifactory UI to Search for a Specific Registry
If you prefer using the Artifactory UI:
1. **Navigate to Your Docker Repository**: Go to the repository where you have stored Docker images.
2. **Use the "Quick Search" or "Advanced Search"**: Type the registry or repository name in the search bar to filter results.
3. **View the Properties of Artifacts**: Click on the images to see the properties like `@docker.repoName`.

### Summary
To search for a specific registry or image within a local Docker repository in Artifactory, you can use AQL to filter based on the `@docker.repoName` property. This allows you to precisely target images within your Docker repository and extract all associated metadata or properties.

- Use `@docker.repoName` to specify the registry and image.
- Use additional filters like `docker.manifest` to filter by tags.
- Execute your AQL query via REST API using a command like `curl` to automate the search.

If you need any more guidance on refining the query or applying it for other use cases, feel free to ask!

**ChatGPT**: The issue you're facing is likely due to an incorrect use of the property condition syntax or a minor formatting error that Artifactory's AQL processor can't handle properly. In AQL, property filters need to be specified in a slightly different way. Below, I'll provide you with a fixed version of your AQL query.

The correct AQL syntax to fix the subquery and property specification should look like this:

```bash
curl -u username:password -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "repo": "docker-local" },
    { "property.key": "@docker.repoName" },
    { "property.value": "myregistry/myimage" }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
'
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Simplified Property Filtering:**
   - The property filter syntax has been adjusted. Instead of using `{ "$eq": { "key": ..., "value": ... } }`, AQL allows for property filtering in a simpler form:
     - `"property.key": "@docker.repoName"` matches artifacts with the property key `@docker.repoName`.
     - `"property.value": "myregistry/myimage"` matches the value assigned to the `@docker.repoName` property.
   - This makes it easier for AQL to interpret and process the query.

### Updated Query Structure:

- The corrected query explicitly matches the desired Docker repository property by separating the property key and value into distinct conditions within the `$and` clause.
- This format is more consistent with AQL's expected structure and avoids issues related to subquery syntax.

### Final Query Example:

Here is the corrected `curl` command with the adjusted AQL query:

```bash
curl -u username:password -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "repo": "docker-local" },
    { "property.key": "@docker.repoName" },
    { "property.value": "myregistry/myimage" }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
'
```

### Alternative Query Approach:

Another way to structure your query that might help resolve the syntax error and make it more readable:

```bash
curl -u username:password -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '
items.find({
  "repo": "docker-local",
  "property": {
    "$match": {
      "key": "@docker.repoName",
      "value": "myregistry/myimage"
    }
  }
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
'
```

### Common Issues and Fixes:

- **Line Breaks:** Ensure that the query does not have unintended line breaks or extra spaces, as this can sometimes cause syntax errors in the `curl` command.
- **Single vs. Double Quotes:** Make sure the entire JSON query is properly enclosed in single quotes (`'`), and any property keys or values are enclosed in double quotes (`"`). This helps to prevent issues with special characters or conflicts when using `curl`.

If you still experience issues, try testing the query with just one filter condition to identify if a specific part is causing the error. Additionally, validating the AQL syntax through Artifactory's UI can also be helpful in pinpointing syntax errors.

**Swapan**: get manifest.json properties for a specific image path

**ChatGPT**: To retrieve the properties of `manifest.json` for a specific image path in an Artifactory Docker repository using AQL, you need to target the repository, specify the image path, and focus specifically on the `manifest.json` file. Here's how to do that.

### Example AQL Query for Retrieving `manifest.json` Properties for a Specific Image Path

```bash
curl -u username:password -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '
items.find({
  "$and": [
    { "repo": "docker-local" },
    { "path": "myregistry/myimage/1.0" },
    { "name": "manifest.json" }
  ]
}).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
'
```

#### Explanation:
- `"repo": "docker-local"`: Specifies the Docker repository to search. Replace `"docker-local"` with the actual repository name.
- `"path": "myregistry/myimage/1.0"`: Targets a specific image path where the manifest is located. Replace `"myregistry/myimage/1.0"` with the actual path of your image. This should correspond to the registry, image name, and tag version.
- `"name": "manifest.json"`: Specifies that you only want to return items with the name `manifest.json`.
- `.include("name", "repo", "path", "property")`: This includes the artifact's name, repository, path, and properties in the result.

### How to Adjust the Query for Different Scenarios:

1. **Search by Partial Path**: 
   If you do not have the exact image path, but know part of it, you can use the `$match` operator:
   
   ```bash
   curl -u username:password -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '
   items.find({
     "$and": [
       { "repo": "docker-local" },
       { "path": { "$match": "myregistry/myimage/*" } },
       { "name": "manifest.json" }
     ]
   }).include("name", "repo", "path", "property")
   '
   ```

   - This query searches for any `manifest.json` within `myregistry/myimage/`, regardless of the tag/version.

2. **Include Only Specific Properties**:
   If you are only interested in specific properties of `manifest.json` files (e.g., `docker.repoName`), you can filter results further:

   ```bash
   curl -u username:password -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/search/aql" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d '
   items.find({
     "$and": [
       { "repo": "docker-local" },
       { "path": "myregistry/myimage/1.0" },
       { "name": "manifest.json" }
     ]
   }).include("name", "repo", "path", "property.key", "property.value")
   '
   ```

   - By including `"property.key"` and `"property.value"`, you will only see the property keys and their values.

### Example Output Structure

The response from Artifactory for this query will be in JSON format and might look something like this:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "repo": "docker-local",
      "path": "myregistry/myimage/1.0",
      "name": "manifest.json",
      "properties": [
        { "key": "@docker.repoName", "value": "myregistry/myimage" },
        { "key": "docker.manifest", "value": "1.0" },
        { "key": "custom.property1", "value": "custom_value1" },
        { "key": "custom.property2", "value": "custom_value2" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`properties`**: This array contains all properties associated with the `manifest.json` file, including both Docker-specific metadata (like `@docker.repoName`) and any custom properties that might have been added.

### Common Issues to Avoid:
1. **Incorrect Path**: Ensure the `"path"` value is correct and matches how the image is stored in Artifactory. It should reflect the hierarchy of `registry/image/tag`.
2. **Missing Include Clause**: If you omit the `.include()` clause, the query might return limited information. Including `"property"` explicitly helps retrieve all associated metadata.

### Summary
- **Target the Specific Repository**: Use `"repo": "docker-local"` to select the Docker repository.
- **Specify the Path and File Name**: Use `"path": "myregistry/myimage/1.0"` and `"name": "manifest.json"` to specifically select the desired manifest.
- **Include Properties**: Use `.include("name", "repo", "path", "property")` to return all properties associated with the manifest.

Using this approach, you can precisely target and retrieve properties of the `manifest.json` files in your Docker repository, giving you detailed metadata about your Docker images. If you need further help tweaking the query to your use case, feel free to ask!
