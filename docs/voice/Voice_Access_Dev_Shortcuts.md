**Swapan**: windows 11 voice access custom shortcuts to speed up development

**ChatGPT**: Windows 11's **Voice Access** can significantly speed up your development process by allowing you to use voice commands to automate repetitive tasks, open applications, navigate code, and execute custom shortcuts. Here's a step-by-step guide to set up **Voice Access** and configure custom shortcuts for development purposes:

---

### 1. **Enable Voice Access**
1. **Open Settings**:
   - Press `Win + I` and go to **Accessibility > Speech**.
2. **Turn on Voice Access**:
   - Under "Voice Access," toggle it on and download any necessary voice files.

---

### 2. **Create Custom Keyboard Shortcuts**
You can create custom shortcuts for frequent tasks, which Voice Access can then trigger by their keybinds.

#### Steps to Create Custom Shortcuts:
1. **Use Windows Shortcuts**:
   - Go to **Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts** to assign system-wide shortcuts for commonly used applications (e.g., `Ctrl + Shift + D` for your IDE).
2. **Use Third-Party Tools (Optional)**:
   - Use tools like **AutoHotkey** to create more advanced, custom shortcuts.
   - Example AutoHotkey script for opening Visual Studio Code:
     ```ahk
     ^+v:: ; Ctrl + Shift + V
     Run "C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe"
     return
     ```

---

### 3. **Map Voice Commands to Shortcuts**
Voice Access allows you to issue commands that correspond to keyboard shortcuts.

#### Example Commands:
- **Say “Press Ctrl + S”** to save your code.
- **Say “Press Alt + Tab”** to switch applications.

#### Automating Actions with Shortcuts:
- Assign Voice Access phrases to specific shortcuts. For instance:
  - **Say “Run the app”** for `Ctrl + F5` in Visual Studio Code.
  - **Say “Build project”** for your IDE's build shortcut.

---

### 4. **Use Macros for Development Commands**
Set up macros for complex tasks (like formatting code, opening terminals, or running tests) using tools such as **Power Automate** or your IDE's macro features.

#### Example:
- In Visual Studio Code, you can use extensions like **Command Macros** to record actions and bind them to shortcuts.

---

### 5. **Enhance Development Workflow with Voice Access**
Here are specific voice commands to speed up your development:

#### Code Navigation
- **"Scroll down/up"**: Moves through your code.
- **"Go to line [number]"**: Jumps to a specific line.
- **"Select [word]"**: Highlights specific code elements.

#### Debugging & Testing
- **"Run tests"**: Triggers your testing framework shortcut.
- **"Start debugger"**: Launches your debugger.

#### Version Control
- **"Commit changes"**: Executes your Git commit shortcut.
- **"Pull changes"**: Runs `git pull` command via terminal shortcut.

---

### 6. **Optimize Voice Commands for Development**
#### Combine Voice Access with IDE Features:
- **VS Code**:
  - Map frequent tasks (e.g., “Open Terminal,” “Format Code”) to easy-to-say commands.
- **JetBrains IDEs**:
  - Use built-in shortcuts for "Refactor," "Run Configuration," or "Show Documentation."
