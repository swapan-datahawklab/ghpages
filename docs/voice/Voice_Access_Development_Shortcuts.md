**Swapan**: windows 11 voice access shortcuts for development

**ChatGPT**: **Analyzing query ambiguity**

The user’s query is asking for "Windows 11 voice access shortcuts for development." It’s a little unclear whether they mean voice access shortcuts specifically for development tasks or voice access shortcuts that can assist with development in general.

I think "Voice Access" in Windows 11 allows users to control their PC with voice commands, and they're probably looking for shortcuts to improve their development workflow using this feature. Let's figure out what they might need for this purpose!

# Get started with voice access

This article is for people who want to control their PC and author text using their voice with Windows. This article is part of the Accessibility support for Windows content set where you can find more information on Windows accessibility features. For general help, visit Microsoft Support home.

This article helps you to get familiar with the user interface, settings, and modes of voice access. You will also learn how to open the voice access guide. For a list of voice access commands, go to Voice access command list.

Voice access is a feature in Windows 11 that enables everyone to control their PC and author text using only their voice and without an internet connection. For example, you can open and switch between apps, browse the web, and read and author email using your voice. For more information, go to Use voice access to control your PC & author text with your voice.

Voice access is available in Windows 11, version 22H2 and later. For more information on Windows 11 22H2 new features, and how to get the update, see What's new in recent Windows updates. Not sure which version of Windows you have? See: Find Windows version.

  * Get to know the voice access UI 

    * Microphone button and states 

    * Visual feedback 

    * Voice access settings 

    * Voice access help 

  * Different modes in voice access 

## Voice access guide

The voice access guide helps you learn and practice basic voice access commands that you need to get started with voice access. Each page in the guide shows various instructions on the left and a practice area on the right. You can follow the instructions on the left to learn the voice commands to interact with different menus and options, use the mouse pointer, and dictate text.  

Once you finish setting up voice access, we recommend you start the guide and familiarize yourself with the commands. You can always access the guide at a later point by accessing it from the voice access help menu.  

Image: Voice access guide window shows the Work with menus and options page. The left side contains steps and instructions for working with the practice area on the right side.

  1. To quickly open the voice access guide, do one of the following:

     * After setting up your microphone, you can either start using voice access right away or open the guide first. For more information, refer to Set up voice access.

     * Select the Help button on the voice access UI, and then select Start interactive guide.

     * When voice access is listening, say "Open voice access guide."

## Get to know the voice access UI

The voice access UI is the bar that is docked on top of your screen after you successfully launch voice access. The bar lets you control the microphone, view your commands as you speak them, and be informed of the command progress and execution status. You can also access the different voice access settings from the settings menu and access the different help resources voice access has to offer from the help menu.

Image: The voice access UI is a horizontal bar on top of the screen. It is currently in listening state.

This section describes the control buttons of voice access UI.

### Microphone button and states

Voice access has three microphone states:

  * Sleep state: Voice access does not react to anything you say, except the command to switch it into listening state. To switch into listening state, say the voice access wake word, "Voice access wake up," or click the Microphone button.  
Image: The voice access UI shows the microphone in “sleep state” with the microphone button not highlighted.

  * Listening state: Voice access listens to everything you say and executes your instructions if it recognizes a valid command. Otherwise, it displays an error message.  
Image: The voice access UI shows the microphone in “Listening…” state, with the microphone button highlighted.

  * Microphone off state: Voice access is completely off at this point and does not listen to any of your speech. To switch it into listening state, you have to click the Microphone button.  
Image: The voice access UI shows “microphone off” status, with the microphone button crossed out to highlight this.

There are three ways you can switch between the states:

  * Through voice commands

  * Keyboard shortcuts

  * Through mouse clicks

To do this

Say this

Keyboard shortcut

Mouse clicks (on the microphone button)  

Wake up voice access.

"Voice access wake up"

"Unmute"

Alt+Shift+B

From sleep state: left-click

From microphone off state: long press  

Make voice access sleep.

"Voice access sleep"

"Mute"

Alt+Shift+B

From listening state: left-click  

Turn off the microphone.

“Turn off microphone”

Alt+Shift+C

From listening state: long press  

Turn on the microphone.

N/A

Alt+Shift+C

Left-click  

Note: If you need help setting up and testing your microphone, refer to How to set up and test microphones in Windows.

### Visual feedback

Voice access has robust feedback systems to help you understand what happens from the time you speak something until the time voice access processes and executes it.

  * Real-time feedback: When voice access is in the listening state, what you speak is displayed on the left side of the voice access UI. It is a transcription of your speech to text. Refer to this to know what voice access heard.

Image: Voice access UI is in listening state, showing "open edge" as the real-time feedback and “opening….” as the command execution status.

  * Command execution status: This is the feedback that appears in the center of the voice access UI. After you speak a command, here is where voice access lets you know that it is processing your speech.

  * Command execution feedback: After voice access processes your speech, if it is a valid command, it performs that action. Otherwise, it displays an error message. This feedback appears when an action is taken, or when voice access cannot perform a given action.

Image: The voice access UI is in listening state, with "open edge" as the real-time feedback and “opened edge” as command execution feedback. Image: The voice access UI is in listening state, with "scroll" as the real-time feedback and “Please tell us which direction you want to scroll in" as command execution feedback with an error message.

### Voice access settings

Image: The settings button on the far right side of the voice access UI is expanded to show the four options: select default microphone, manage options, languages, and turn off voice access. The Languages option is further expanded to show the languages.

When you click the Settings button, the following options are available:

  * Select default microphone: This menu lets you switch to a different microphone from the one you are using, or to add a new microphone if you do not find the one you are looking for. You also have quick access to Windows Sound settings from this menu.

  * Manage options: This menu contains the following options:

    * Turn on automatic punctuation: Refer to section "Turn on automatic punctuation" in Dictate text with voice.

    * Filter profanity: Refer to section "Use profanity filtering" in Dictate text with voice.

    * Automatic startup setting: This opens up the Speech section under Accessibility settings, here you can enable voice access to launch automatically before or after logging into your computer.

  * Languages: This menu contains the list of languages you can use voice access in. There are "ready to use" languages which you can instantly switch to and "available for download" languages for which you need to download the speech pack before you can start using it. 

  * Turn off voice access: This removes the voice access UI from the top of the screen and closes voice access. To launch voice access again, go to Settings > Accessibility > Speech.

### Voice access help

Image: The help button on the far right side of the voice access UI is expanded to show the various options.

When you click the Help button, the following options are available:

  * View all commands: This takes you to a list of all voice access commands which helps you as you are working with voice access to perform different tasks. You can look for any command you need in the command category list on the left or use the search bar to quickly type out what you need.

Tip: You can also bring up the command help list by saying "What can I say" or "Show all commands."

Image: Voice access commands help main page.

To learn more about what a certain command means, how it can be used, and to get examples, click the command on the help page.

  * Start interactive guide: This pulls up the same guide that opens when you launch and set up voice access for the first time. You can use this to practice working with different voice commands.

Tip: You can also bring up the guide by saying "Open voice access guide."

  * Learn more about voice access: With this option, you can quickly access the voice access documentation.

  * View Microsoft Privacy Statement: With this option, you can access and view the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

  * Give feedback: This takes you to the Feedback Hub where you can log any issues that you see while working with voice access, or send any product improvement suggestions you have for us.

Note: The voice access UI is removed once you turn off voice access. This can be done from the settings menu or using the voice command “Turn off voice access” or “Stop voice access.”

## Different modes in voice access

You can work in three different modes based on the tasks you want to perform. In the default mode you can seamlessly switch between commands and authoring text. If you want to issue only commands for performing all tasks but no dictation, use the commands mode. If you want to be able to dictate text and not issue any commands, use the dictation mode, which treats every input as something to be input in an editable field.

Image: The voice access UI shows command execution feedback as "switched to command mode." Before the settings and help buttons we have the text “command mode.”

Function

Command  

Switch to commands only mode.

"Commands mode"  

Switch to dictation only mode.

"Dictation mode"  

Switch to default mode (commands & dictation).

"Default mode"  

Note: Voice access also gives you a visual cue on what mode it is in. If it is on commands mode or dictation mode, you see the mode on the UI. If it is in the default mode, there won’t be any specific message on the UI.

# Set up voice access

This article is for people who want to control their PC and author text using their voice with Windows. This article is part of the Accessibility support for Windows content set where you can find more information on Windows accessibility features. For general help, visit Microsoft Support home.

To complete the initial set up voice access in Windows, you need an internet connection. For a list of voice access commands, go to Voice access command list.

Voice access is a feature in Windows 11 that enables everyone to control their PC and author text using only their voice and without an internet connection. For example, you can open and switch between apps, browse the web, and read and author email using your voice. For more information, go to Use voice access to control your PC & author text with your voice.

Voice access is available in Windows 11, version 22H2 and later. For more information on Windows 11 22H2 new features, and how to get the update, see What's new in recent Windows updates. Not sure which version of Windows you have? See: Find Windows version.

## In this topic

  * Launch voice access 

  * Download language files 

  * Set up your microphone 

## Launch voice access

You can launch voice access from Settings or by using Windows search.

### Start voice access from Settings

Image: Accessibility settings page with Voice access toggled on and check boxes to start voice access before or after sign-in.

  1. In the Start menu, select Settings Accessibility Speech.

  2. Turn on the Voice access switch.

Tip: If you want to automatically launch voice access every time you start your computer, select the “Start voice access before you sign in to your PC” or “Start voice access after you sign into your PC” checkboxes.

### Start voice access from Windows search

Image: You can search for voice access from Start or use the search option in the taskbar. If you type voice access, it comes up as the top result.

  1. Open Windows search and type voice access.

  2. Select Open to start voice access.

Tip: Select Pin to Start or Pin to taskbar to make voice access quicker to find in the future.

## Download language files

Voice access is currently available in the following languages and dialects: English–US, English–UK, English–India, English–New Zealand, English–Canada, English–Australia, Spanish–Spain, Spanish–Mexico, German–Germany, French–France, and French–Canada. The first time you launch voice access we check if your display language is something that is supported. If yes, you can continue with the setup experience. If we identify that your display language is not in the supported list of languages, we still give you the option to launch voice access, but in English (US). You can either choose to proceed at this point or turn off voice access.

  1. When you turn on voice access for the first time, you are prompted to download voice access language files to be used by on-device speech recognition. Select Download to continue or Not now if you want to do it later. The download might take a few minutes.

  2. If you want to learn more before downloading, select the More about voice access and Microsoft Privacy Statement links.

  3. You can switch to a different language at any time from Voice Access Settings Languages.

Notes: 

  * Once the language files have been downloaded, voice access works regardless of your internet connection status.

  * If you face any problems downloading the language files, refer to Troubleshooting live captions or voice access setup issues for further guidance.

## Set up your microphone

After successfully downloading the language files, you can now use voice access both online and offline. However, before you get started, you have to select which microphone you want to use.

  1. When the speech model is downloaded, the Set up your mic for voice access window opens. Select the microphone you want to use from the Microphone list if it's not already selected.

  2. If you are unable to find the microphone you want to use from the list, select Add new microphone. If you need to check or adjust any sound-related settings, select Sound settings.

  3. Select(Next), and then select Done to finish setting up voice access and start using it right away. Alternatively, you can first read the interactive guide. For more information, refer to Getting started with voice access.

Note: Use of the microphone by voice access is controlled by your privacy settings. To check that microphone use is allowed, navigate to Settings Privacy & security Microphone Let apps access your microphone Let desktop apps access your microphone.

Image: Set up your mic for voice access window asking you to select the mic you want to use

Note: Voice access works best with a microphone that is less likely to capture background and ambient sounds. For more information, refer to section "Voice access settings" in Getting started with voice access.

This tutorial will show you how to create voice shortcuts for custom commands to use in voice access for your account in Windows 11.  

Voice access is a new experience starting with Windows 11 build 22518 that enables everyone, including people with mobility disabilities, to control their PC and author text using only their voice and without an internet connection. For example, you can open and switch between apps, browse the web, and read and author email using your voice.  

Starting with Windows 11 build 22631.3374, Microsoft is introducing voice shortcuts or custom commands to enable you to create your very own command. This is currently available if you use voice access in English.  

You can create commands that map to a single action, such as opening a URL, or a series of actions performed in sequence.  

Here's How:  

1 Turn on Voice Access.  

2 Open the Voice access commands page.  

3 Click/tap on Voice shortcuts in the left pane, and click/tap on the Create new shortcut button in the right pane. (see screenshot below)  

Image: Voice_shortcuts-1.png 

4 In the When I say box, type or say the voice command (ex: "Insert work address") you want for this shortcut. (see screenshot below)  

Image: Voice_shortcuts-2.png 

5 Select an action you want for this shortcut in the Perform action(s) drop menu. (see screenshot below)  

Image: Voice_shortcuts-3.png 

6 Enter any necessary information for the selected action, and click/tap on Apply. (see screenshot below)  

Image: Voice_shortcuts-4.png 

7 Under Add this shortcut to group, perform one of the following actions you want: (see screenshots below)  

  * Use the currently selected group name (ex: "General (default)").
  * Click/tap on the current group name (ex: "General (default)"), enter a name (ex: "Custom") you want to create a new group, and click/tap on Add.
  * Click/tap on the current group name (ex: "General (default)"), and click/tap on a group you want to select to add this voice shortcut to.

7 Click/tap on Save. (see screenshot below)

8 When finished, you can close the Voice access commands window.  

That's it,  
Shawn Brink

What makes this better than the native windows va?

customizability / depth of feature set for interacting with UI controls, macros, etc. Specifically you want Talon with Cursorless - https://www.cursorless.org/ 

I'm personally mostly just using dictation, so I tend to stick with VA. But if I was trying to move to use voice more, I'd use talon. 

I ended up getting a svalboard lightly keyboard, so that helped a lot. https://svalboard.com/ 

More here - https://handsfreecoding.org/ and theres a talon slack thats pretty active.

# Use voice to create voice access shortcuts

This article is for people who want to control their PC and author text using their voice with Windows. This article is part of the Accessibility support for Windows content set where you can find more information on Windows accessibility features. For general help, visit Microsoft Support home.

Voice access is a feature in Windows 11 that enables everyone to control their PC and author text using only their voice and without an internet connection. For example, you can open and switch between apps, browse the web, and read and author email using your voice. For more information, go to Use voice access to control your PC & author text with your voice.

Voice shortcuts allow you to create custom commands for the tasks that you perform often.

## In this article

Types of voice shortcuts  

Create your voice shortcuts 

Manage your voice shortcuts 

## Types of voice shortcuts

When creating voice shortcuts, you can choose from different types of actions to make your commands do specific tasks. The following actions are included in the drop-down list of the Create new shortcut page:Image: Create new shortcut page with drop-down list in Perform action(s) expanded. It shows the Type of actions enlisted.

  1. Paste text and media- This action type allows you to paste text or media blocks, such as your address or phone number, wherever you need to input them.

  2. Open folders/files/applications/URL- This action type is useful for quickly accessing any file, folder, application, or website, especially for multistep tasks or if you want to create a nickname for the standard open command.

  3. Press keyboard keys- This action type allows you to assign any combination of keyboard strokes to a command.  It is useful if you use a screen reader or if you primarily use keyboard shortcuts to work with applications, like gaming.

  4. Press mouse click- This action type allows you to perform single, double, and triple clicks and specify which element you want to click on. This can be useful for completing multistep processes.

  5. Add wait time- This action type is useful in a multi-step process where some actions take longer to execute than others. Adding a wait time ensures that all steps are performed in a sequence, without overlaps, and preventing unfavorable outcomes in your shortcut.

Note: Your shortcut can consist of one action or a combination of actions, with a maximum of eight actions per shortcut.

## Create your voice shortcuts

To create your voice shortcut using your voice, follow these steps:

  1. Activate voice access by saying “Unmute,” or “Voice access wake up.”

  2. Say “Open voice shortcuts” to go to the Voice shortcuts page.Image: Voice shortcuts page with the Create new shortcut button.

Tip: You can also access the Voice shortcuts page by navigating to the Help button on the voice access bar, selecting View all commands, and then selecting Voice shortcuts from the navigation pane.

  3. Say “Click create new shortcut” to open the Create new shortcut page.Image: Create new shortcut page with edit fields and a drop-down list for the Title of the shortcut, type of action or actions, and add a shortcut to a group.

Note: To explore additional methods for interacting with on-screen items, refer to Use voice to interact with items on the screen.

  4. Say “Click when I say” and dictate the name you want for your shortcut. For example, if you want to create a shortcut for entering your home address, say “Address.”

  5. Say “Click perform actions” to expand the Choose action drop-down list.

  6. Then, say “Click your action type” to select the type of action you want for your shortcut. For example, for the shortcut to enter your home address, say “Click paste text and media.” Image: Create new shortcut page with the a shortcut titled "Address." The action type is selected as Paste text and media. An edit box to type the address opens after selecting the action type as paste text and media.

  7. Again, say “Click paste text and media” to focus on the Paste text and media edit box.

    1. Dictate your address in the edit box or paste the text using the Paste button in the edit box.Image: Create new shortcut page with an example address filled in the Paste text and media edit box. It is an as an example to keep Address as a shorctcuty.

Note: This step may vary depending on the action type.

  8. Say “Click apply” to confirm your customized action.

     * To add more actions to your shortcut, say “Click add next action,” and choose the action you want to add.

Note: Voice access shortcuts allow stringing multiple actions together for more complex shortcuts.

  9. Your shortcut will be saved in General group by default. To create a new group:

    1. On the Create new shortcut page, say “Click add this shortcut to group” to expand Add this shortcut to group element.

    2. Say “Click create new group” to focus on the Create a new group edit box and dictate the name you want to give to the new group. For example, for creating a new group for the address shortcut, say “Personal Information” when the focus is on the Create a new group edit box.

    3. Say “Click add” to add the new group to the list.

  10. To save the shortcut, say “Click save.” Your shortcut will appear below the "Create a new shortcut" button on the Voice shortcuts main page.  Image: Voice shortcuts page showing the customized groups for your shortcuts. The "Address" shortcut is nested under the " Personal information" group.

Note: Voice shortcuts are currently available in English–US, English–UK, English–India, English–New Zealand, English–Canada, and English–Australia.

## Manage your voice shortcuts

Once you’ve created your shortcuts, they will appear on the Voice shortcuts page. You can edit and manage them using the following steps:

  1. Say “Open voice shortcuts” to access your shortcuts.

  2. To enable or disable a shortcut:

    1. Say “Toggle your shortcut name” on the Voice access shortcuts page to turn a shortcut On or Off. For example, for the address shortcut, say “Toggle address.”

  3. To edit the name or actions in a shortcut:

    1. Say “Click your shortcut name” and click the arrow icon beside the Voice shortcut toggle switch to see the edit page of the shortcut.

    2. If a shortcut is no longer needed, you can delete it by selecting the Delete button on the edit page.

## Overview and features
### Macros

WSR supports custom macros through a supplementary application by Microsoft that enables additional natural language commands. As an example of this functionality, an email macro released by Microsoft enables a natural language command where a user can speak "send email to contact about subject," which opens Microsoft Outlook to compose a new message with the designated contact and subject automatically inserted. Microsoft has also released sample macros for the speech dictionary, for Windows Media Player, for Microsoft PowerPoint, for speech synthesis, to switch between multiple microphones, to customize various aspects of audio device configuration such as volume levels, and for general natural language queries such as "What is the weather forecast?" "What time is it?" and "What's the date?" Responses to these user inquiries are spoken back to the user in the active Microsoft text-to-speech voice installed on the machine.

Application or item | Sample macro phrases (italics indicate substitutable words)
Microsoft Outlook | Send email | Send email to | Send email to Makoto | Send email to Makoto Yamagishi | Send email to Makoto Yamagishi about | Send email to Makoto Yamagishi about This week's meeting | Refresh Outlook email contacts
Microsoft PowerPoint | Next slide | Previous slide | Next | Previous | Go forward 5 slides | Go back 3 slides | Go to slide 8
Windows Media Player | Next track | Previous song | Play Beethoven | Play something by Mozart | Play the CD that has In the Hall of the Mountain King | Play something written in 1930 | Pause music
Microphones in Windows | Microphone | Switch microphone | Microphone Array microphone | Switch to Line | Switch to Microphone Array | Switch to Line microphone | Switch to Microphone Array microphone
Volume levels in Windows | Mute the speakers | Unmute the speakers | Turn off the audio | Increase the volume | Increase the volume by 2 times | Decrease the volume by 50 | Set the volume to 66
WSR Speech Dictionary | Export the speech dictionary | Add a pronunciation | Add that [selected text] to the speech dictionary | Block that [selected text] from the speech dictionary | Remove that [selected text] | [Selected text] sounds like... | What does that [selected text] sound like?
Speech Synthesis | Read that [selected text] | Read the next 3 paragraphs | Read the previous sentence | Please stop reading | What time is it? | What's today's date? | Tell me the weather forecast for Redmond



Users and developers can create their own macros based on text transcription and substitution; application execution (with support for command-line arguments); keyboard shortcuts; emulation of existing voice commands; or a combination of these items. XML, JScript and VBScript are supported. Macros can be limited to specific applications and rules for macros can be defined programmatically.
For a macro to load, it must be stored in a Speech Macros folder within the active user's Documents directory. All macros are digitally signed by default if a user certificate is available to ensure that stored commands are not altered or loaded by third-parties; if a certificate is not available, an administrator can create one. Configurable security levels can prohibit unsigned macros from being loaded; to prompt users to sign macros after creation; and to load unsigned macros.

### Common commands

Listed below are common WSR commands. Words in italics indicate a word that can be substituted for the desired item (e.g., "direction" in "scroll direction" can be substituted with the word "down"). A "start typing" command enables WSR to interpret all dictation commands as keyboard shortcuts.

 Dictation commands: "New line"; "New paragraph"; "Tab"; "Literal word"; "Numeral number"; "Go to word"; "Go after word"; "No space"; "Go to start of sentence"; "Go to end of sentence"; "Go to start of paragraph"; "Go to end of paragraph"; "Go to start of document" "Go to end of document"; "Go to field name" (e.g., go to address, cc, or subject). Special characters such as a comma are dictated by speaking the name of the special character.
Navigation commands:
Keyboard shortcuts: "Press keyboard key"; "Press  plus "; "Press capital ."
 Keys that can be pressed without first giving the press command include: , , , , , , , and .
Mouse commands: "Click"; "Click that"; "Double-click"; "Double-click that"; "Mark"; "Mark that"; "Right-click"; "Right-click that"; "MouseGrid".
Window management commands: "Close (alternatively maximize, minimize, or restore) window"; "Close that"; "Close name of open application"; "Switch applications"; "Switch to name of open application"; "Scroll direction"; "Scroll direction in number of pages"; "Show desktop"; "Show Numbers."
Speech recognition commands: "Start listening"; "Stop listening"; "Show speech options"; "Open speech dictionary"; "Move speech recognition"; "Minimize speech recognition"; "Restore speech recognition". In the English language, applicable commands can be shown by speaking "What can I say?" Users can also query the recognizer about tasks in Windows by speaking "How do I task name" (e.g., "How do I install a printer?") which opens related help documentation.

#### MouseGrid

MouseGrid enables users to control the mouse cursor by overlaying numbers across nine regions on the screen; these regions gradually narrow as a user speaks the number(s) of the region on which to focus until the desired interface element is reached. Users can then issue commands including "Click number of region," which moves the mouse cursor to the desired region and then clicks it; and "Mark number of region", which allows an item (such as a computer icon) in a region to be selected, which can then be clicked with the previous click command. Users also can interact with multiple regions at once.

#### Show Numbers

Applications and interface elements that do not present identifiable commands can still be controlled by asking the system to overlay numbers on top of them through a Show Numbers command. Once active, speaking the overlaid number selects that item so a user can open it or perform other operations. Show Numbers was designed so that users could interact with items that are not readily identifiable.

**ChatGPT**: citeturn0search11  [wordlim: 200] Published: 5 days ago; Microsoft Speech API
Application programming interface for Microsoft Windows



The Speech Application Programming Interface or SAPI is an API developed by Microsoft to allow the use of speech recognition and speech synthesis within Windows applications. To date, a number of versions of the API have been released, which have shipped either as part of a Speech SDK or as part of the Windows OS itself. Applications that use SAPI include Microsoft Office, Microsoft Agent and Microsoft Speech Server.

In general, all versions of the API have been designed such that a software developer can write an application to perform speech recognition and synthesis by using a standard set of interfaces, accessible from a variety of programming languages. In addition, it is possible for a 3rd-party company to produce their own Speech Recognition and Text-To-Speech engines or adapt existing engines to work with SAPI. In principle, as long as these engines conform to the defined interfaces they can be used instead of the Microsoft-supplied engines.

In general, the Speech API is a freely redistributable component which can be shipped with any Windows application that wishes to use speech technology. Many versions (although not all) of the speech recognition and synthesis engines are also freely redistributable.

There have been two main 'families' of the Microsoft Speech API. SAPI versions 1 through 4 are all similar to each other, with extra features in each newer version. SAPI 5, however, was a completely new interface, released in 2000. Since then several sub-versions of this API have been released.

## Basic architecture

The Speech API can be viewed as an interface or piece of middleware which sits between applications and speech engines (recognition and synthesis). In SAPI versions 1 to 4, applications could directly communicate with engines. The API included an abstract interface definition which applications and engines conformed to. Applications could also use simplified higher-level objects rather than directly call methods on the engines.

In SAPI 5 however, applications and engines do not directly communicate with each other. Instead, each talks to a runtime component (sapi.dll). There is an API implemented by this component which applications use, and another set of interfaces for engines.

Typically in SAPI 5 applications issue calls through the API (for example to load a recognition grammar; start recognition; or provide text to be synthesized). The sapi.dll runtime component interprets these commands and processes them, where necessary calling on the engine through the engine interfaces (for example, the loading of grammar from a file is done in the runtime, but then the grammar data is passed to the recognition engine to actually use in recognition). The recognition and synthesis engines also generate events while processing (for example, to indicate an utterance has been recognized or to indicate word boundaries in the synthesized speech). These pass in the reverse direction, from the engines, through the runtime DLL, and on to an event sink in the application.

In addition to the actual API definition and runtime DLL, other components are shipped with all versions of SAPI to make a complete Speech Software Development Kit. The following components are among those included in most versions of the Speech SDK:
* API definition files - in MIDL and as C or C++ header files.
* Runtime components - e.g. sapi.dll.
* Control Panel applet - to select and configure default speech recognizer and synthesizer.
* Text-To-Speech engines in multiple languages.
* Speech Recognition engines in multiple languages.
* Redistributable components to allow developers to package the engines and runtime with their application code to produce a single installable application.
* Sample application code.
* Sample engines - implementations of the necessary engine interfaces but with no true speech processing which could be used as a sample for those porting an engine to SAPI.
* Documentation.

## Speech functionality in Windows Vista

Windows Vista includes a number of new speech-related features including:
* Speech control of the full Windows GUI and applications
* New tutorial, microphone wizard, and UI for controlling speech recognition
* New version of the Speech API runtime: SAPI 5.3

* Managed code speech API (codenamed SpeechFX)
* Speech recognition support for 8 languages at release time: U.S. English, U.K. English, traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, and German, with more language to be released later.

Microsoft Agent most notably, and all other Microsoft speech applications use SAPI 5.

**Swapan**: windows 11 voice access shortcuts for development and hands free

**ChatGPT**: **Explaining voice access shortcuts**

The user is asking about Windows 11 voice access shortcuts, which can be helpful for both development and hands-free usage. Voice access in Windows 11 supports custom voice shortcuts that allow hands-free control. These can include running common development commands or accessing folders. For instance, using voice commands to press keys or open folders. There are tutorials available on creating custom voice shortcuts, such as “Create Voice Shortcuts for Custom Commands” in Windows 11 and accessing the command list via voice.

**Summarizing voice access for dev tasks**

Windows 11 Voice Access offers built-in voice commands like “Voice Access wake up” to unmute, “Turn off microphone,” and “Show numbers” for navigation. For development, you can create custom voice shortcuts to perform tasks like opening Visual Studio, inserting a semicolon, or running build commands. The tutorial from ElevenForum explains how to set up these custom shortcuts for tasks such as launching applications or triggering text snippets, offering hands-free control tailored to your development needs.

**ChatGPT**: Windows 11’s Voice Access isn’t just for general accessibility—it’s also a powerful tool for hands‑free productivity and even development tasks. You can use built‑in voice commands to control your PC (for example, saying “Voice access wake up” to activate listening or “Turn off microphone” to pause it) and, more importantly for developers, you can create custom voice shortcuts that map to complex actions. 

### Custom Voice Shortcuts for Development

Using the custom shortcuts feature, you can create commands that:
  
- **Launch applications:** For instance, saying “Open Visual Studio” could start your IDE.  
- **Emulate keyboard shortcuts:** You might set up a command like “Insert semicolon” that sends a semicolon keystroke, which can speed up coding when you’re hands‑free.  
- **Paste code snippets or text blocks:** Create shortcuts for frequently used code segments or templates.  
- **Sequence multiple actions:** Combine a series of actions (like opening a file, waiting a moment, and then executing a build command) into one voice command.

### How to Set Them Up

1. **Activate Voice Access:** Say “Unmute” or “Voice access wake up” to get started.  
2. **Open the Voice Shortcuts Page:** You can say “Open voice shortcuts” or navigate via the help menu on the Voice Access bar.  
3. **Create a New Shortcut:** Say “Click create new shortcut” to begin defining your custom command.  
4. **Define Your Command and Action:** In the “When I say” box, dictate your command (e.g., “Open Visual Studio”). Then select the action type (such as “Open folders/files/applications/URL” or “Press keyboard keys”) and input any additional parameters (for example, the executable path or key combination).  
5. **Save and Group:** Optionally, group your shortcuts (e.g., “Development”) to keep them organized, then save.

### Hands‑Free Coding

With these shortcuts, you can reduce reliance on the keyboard and mouse:
  
- **Navigation:** Use voice to scroll, switch between windows, or even “show numbers” on clickable items.  
- **Text Editing:** Issue commands for “copy,” “paste,” or even dictate punctuation and formatting.  
- **Multi‑step Macros:** Chain actions together to automate repetitive tasks—ideal for debugging or deployment routines.

This hands‑free approach can be particularly useful if you’re looking to minimize repetitive strain or simply want to speed up your workflow by using your natural language to interact with your development environment.

For a detailed step‑by‑step guide, check out tutorials like the one on ElevenForum that shows exactly how to set up these custom voice shortcuts for Windows 11 Voice Access. citeturn0search2, citeturn0search8
